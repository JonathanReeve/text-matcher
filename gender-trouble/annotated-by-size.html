  <body><section id="blocks"></section><main><pre><span class="c-0"><a name="b-0"></a>Ten years ago I completed the manuscript of Gender Trouble and sent it
to Routledge for publication. I did not know that the text would have
as wide an audience as it has had, nor did I know that it would constitute a provocative “intervention” in feminist theory or be cited as one
of the founding texts of queer theory.The life of the text has exceeded
my intentions, and that is surely in part the result of the changing context of its reception. As I wrote it, I </span><span class="c-2">understood myself to be in an
embattled and oppositional relation to certain forms of feminism, even
as I understood the text to be part of feminism </span><span class="c-0">itself. I was writing in
the tradition of immanent critique that seeks to </span><span class="c-2">provoke critical examination of the basic vocabulary of the movement of thought to which it
belongs.</span><span class="c-0"> There was and remains warrant for such a mode of criticism
and to distinguish between self-criticism that promises a more democratic and inclusive life for the movement and criticism that seeks to
undermine it altogether. Of course, it is always possible to misread the
former as the latter, but I would hope that that will not be done in the
case of Gender Trouble.
In 1989 I was most concerned to criticize a pervasive heterosexual
assumption in feminist literary theory. I sought to counter those views
that made presumptions about the limits and propriety of gender and
restricted the meaning of gender to received notions of masculinity
and femininity. It was and remains my view that any feminist theory
~
that restricts the meaning of gender in the presuppositions of its own
practice sets up exclusionary gender norms within feminism, often
with homophobic consequences. It seemed to me, and continues to
seem, that feminism ought to be careful not to idealize certain expressions of gender that, in turn, produce new forms of hierarchy and
exclusion. In particular, I </span><span class="c-1">opposed those regimes of truth that stipulated that certain kinds of gendered expressions were found to be false or
derivative, and others, true and original. The point was not to prescribe a new gendered way of life that might then serve as a model for
readers of the text. Rather, the aim of the text was to open up the field
of possibility for gender without dictating which kinds of possibilities
ought to be realized. One might wonder what use “opening up possibilities” </span><span class="c-3">finally is, but no one who has understood what it is to live in
the social world as what is “impossible,” illegible, unrealizable, unreal,
and illegitimate is likely to pose that question.</span><span class="c-0">
Gender Trouble sought to uncover the ways in which the very thinking of what is possible in gendered life is foreclosed by certain habitual
and violent presumptions. The text also sought to undermine any and
all efforts to wield a discourse of truth to delegitimate minority gendered and sexual practices. This doesn’t mean that all minority practices are to be condoned or celebrated, but it does mean that we ought
to be able to think them before we come to any kinds of conclusions
about them.What worried me most were the ways that the panic in the
face of such practices rendered them unthinkable. Is the breakdown of
gender binaries, for instance, so monstrous, so frightening, that it must
be held to be definitionally impossible and heuristically precluded
from any effort to think gender?
Some of these kinds of presumptions were found in what was
called “French Feminism” at the time, and they enjoyed great popularity among literary scholars and some social theorists.
Even as I opposed what I took to be the heterosexism at the core of
sexual difference fundamentalism, I also drew from French poststructuralism to make my points. My work in Gender Trouble turned out to be
~
one of cultural translation. Poststructuralist theory was brought to bear
on U.S. theories of gender and the political predicaments of feminism. If
in some of its guises, poststructuralism appears as a formalism, aloof
from questions of social context and political aim, that has not been the
case with its more recent American appropriations. Indeed, my point
was not to “apply” poststructuralism to feminism, but to subject those
theories to a specifically feminist reformulation.Whereas some defenders of poststructuralist formalism express dismay at the avowedly “thematic” orientation it receives in works such as Gender Trouble, the
critiques of poststructuralism within the cultural Left have expressed
strong skepticism toward the claim that anything politically progressive
can come of its premises. In both accounts, however, poststructuralism
is considered something unified, pure, and monolithic. In recent years,
however, that theory, or set of theories, has migrated into gender and
sexuality studies, postcolonial and race studies. It has lost the formalism
of its earlier instance and acquired a new and transplanted life in the
domain of cultural theory. There are continuing debates about whether
my own work or the work of Homi K. Bhabha, Gayatri Chakravorty
Spivak, or Slavoj Žižek belongs to cultural studies or critical theory, but
perhaps such questions simply show that the strong distinction between
the two enterprises has broken down.There will be theorists who claim
that all of the above belong to cultural studies, and there will be cultural
studies practitioners who define themselves against all manner of theory
(although not, significantly, Stuart Hall, one of the founders of cultural
studies in Britain). But both sides of the debate sometimes miss the
point that the face of theory has changed precisely through its cultural
appropriations. There is a new venue for theory, necessarily impure,
where it emerges in and as the very event of cultural translation.This is
not the displacement of theory by historicism, nor a simple historicization of theory that exposes the contingent limits of its more generalizable claims. It is, rather, the emergence of theory at the site where
cultural horizons meet, </span><span class="c-1">where the demand for translation is acute and
its promise of success, uncertain.</span><span class="c-0">
~
Gender Trouble is rooted in “French Theory,” which is itself a curious
American construction. Only in the United States are so many disparate
theories joined together as if they formed some kind of unity. Although
the book has been translated into several languages and has had an especially strong impact on discussions of gender and politics in Germany, it
will emerge in France, if it finally does, much later than in other countries. I mention this to underscore that the apparent Francocentrism of
the text is at a significant distance from France and from the life of theory in France. Gender Trouble tends to read together, in a syncretic vein,
various French intellectuals (Lévi-Strauss, Foucault, Lacan, Kristeva,
Wittig) who had few alliances with one another and whose readers in
France rarely, if ever, read one another. Indeed, the </span><span class="c-1">intellectual promiscuity of the text marks it precisely as American and makes it foreign to a
French context.</span><span class="c-0"> So does its emphasis on the Anglo-American sociological and anthropological tradition of “gender” studies, which is distinct
from the discourse of “sexual difference” derived from structuralist
inquiry. If the text runs the risk of Eurocentrism in the U.S., it has
threatened an “Americanization” of theory in France for those few
French publishers who have considered it.1
Of course, “French Theory” is not the only language of this text. It
emerges from a long engagement with feminist theory, with the debates
on the socially constructed character of gender, with psychoanalysis and
feminism, with Gayle Rubin’s extraordinary work on gender, sexuality,
and kinship, Esther Newton’s groundbreaking work on drag, Monique
Wittig’s brilliant theoretical and fictional writings, and with gay and
lesbian perspectives in the humanities. Whereas many feminists in the
1980s assumed that lesbianism meets feminism in lesbian-feminism,
Gender Trouble sought to refuse the notion that lesbian practice instantiates feminist theory, and set up a more troubled relation between the
two terms. Lesbianism in this text does not represent a return to what
is most important about being a woman; it does not consecrate femininity or signal a gynocentric world. Lesbianism is not the erotic con-

~
summation of a set of political beliefs (sexuality and belief are related in
a much more complex fashion, and very often at odds with one another). Instead, the text asks, how do </span><span class="c-1">non-normative sexual practices call
into question the stability of gender as a category of analysis?</span><span class="c-0"> How do
certain sexual practices compel the question: what is a woman, what is
a man? If gender is no longer to be understood as consolidated through
normative sexuality, then is there a crisis of gender that is specific to
queer contexts?
The idea that sexual practice has the power to destabilize gender
emerged from my reading of Gayle Rubin’s “The Traffic in Women” and
sought to establish that normative sexuality fortifies normative gender.
Briefly, one is a woman, according to this framework, to the extent
that one functions as one within the dominant heterosexual frame and
to call the frame into question is perhaps to lose something of one’s
sense of place in gender. I take it that this is the first formulation of
“gender trouble” in this text. I sought to understand some of the terror
and anxiety that some people suffer in “becoming gay,” the fear of losing one’s place in gender or of not knowing who one will be if one
sleeps with someone of the ostensibly “same” gender.This constitutes a
certain crisis in ontology experienced at the level of both sexuality and
language. This issue has become more acute as we consider various
new forms of gendering that have emerged in light of transgenderism
and transsexuality, lesbian and gay parenting, new butch and femme
identities. When and why, for instance, do some butch lesbians who
become parents become “dads” and others become “moms”?
What about the notion, suggested by Kate Bornstein, that a transsexual cannot be described by the noun of “woman” or “man,” but must
be approached through active verbs that attest to the constant transformation which “is” the new identity or, indeed, the “in-betweenness”
that puts the being of gendered identity into question? Although some
lesbians argue that butches have nothing to do with “being a man,” others insist that their butchness is or was only a route to a desired status

~
as a man. These paradoxes have surely proliferated in recent years,
offering evidence of a kind of gender trouble that the text itself did not
anticipate.2
But what is the link between gender and sexuality that I sought
to underscore? Certainly, I do not mean to claim that forms of sexual
practice produce certain genders, but only that under conditions of
normative heterosexuality, policing gender is sometimes used as a wa<a name="b-1"></a>y
of securing heterosexuality. Catharine MacKinnon offers a formulation
of this problem that resonates with my own at the same time that there
are, I believe, crucial and important differences between us. She writes:
</span><span class="c-2">Stopped as an attribute of a person, sex inequality takes the form of
gender; moving as a relation between people, it takes the form of
sexuality. Gender emerges as the congealed form of the sexualization
of inequality between men and women.</span><span class="c-0">3

In this view, sexual hierarchy produces and consolidates gender. It is
not heterosexual normativity that produces and consolidates gender,
but the gender hierarchy that is said to underwrite heterosexual relations. If gender hierarchy produces and consolidates gender, and if gender hierarchy presupposes an operative notion of gender, then gender is
what causes gender, and the formulation culminates in tautology. It may
be that MacKinnon wants merely to outline the self-reproducing mechanism of gender hierarchy, but this is not what she has said.
Is “gender hierarchy” sufficient to explain the conditions for
the production of gender? To what extent does gender hierarchy
serve a more or less compulsory heterosexuality, and how often are
gender norms policed precisely in the service of shoring up heterosexual hegemony?
Katherine Franke, a contemporary legal theorist, makes innovative
use of both feminist and queer perspectives to note that by assuming
the primacy of gender hierarchy to the production of gender,
MacKinnon also accepts a presumptively heterosexual model for
thinking about sexuality. Franke offers an alternative model of gender
~
discrimination to MacKinnon’s, effectively arguing that sexual harassment is the paradigmatic allegory for the production of gender. Not all
discrimination can be understood as harassment.The act of harassment
may be one in which a person is “made” into a certain gender. But there
are others ways of enforcing gender as well. Thus, for Franke, it is
important to make a provisional distinction between gender and sexual discrimination. Gay people, for instance, may be discriminated
against in positions of employment because they fail to “appear” in
accordance with accepted gendered norms. And the sexual harassment
of gay people may well take place not in the service of shoring up gender hierarchy, but in promoting gender normativity.
Whereas MacKinnon offers a powerful critique of sexual harassment, she institutes a regulation of another kind: to have a gender
means to have entered already into a heterosexual relationship of subordination. At an analytic level, she makes an equation that resonates with
some dominant forms of homophobic argument. One such view prescribes and condones the sexual ordering of gender, maintaining that
men who are men will be straight, women who are women will be
straight.There is another set of views, Franke’s included, which offers a
critique precisely of this form of gender regulation.There is thus a difference between sexist and feminist views on the relation between gender and sexuality: the sexist claims that a woman only exhibits her
womanness in the act of heterosexual coitus in which her subordination
becomes her pleasure (an essence emanates and is confirmed in the sexualized subordination of women); a feminist view argues that gender
should be </span><span class="c-1">overthrown, eliminated, or rendered fatally ambiguous precisely because it is always a sign of subordination for women.</span><span class="c-0">The latter
accepts the power of the former’s orthodox description, accepts that
the former’s description already operates as powerful ideology, but
seeks to oppose it.
I belabor this point because some queer theorists have drawn
an analytic distinction between gender and sexuality, refusing a causal
or structural link between them. This makes good sense from one
~
perspective: if what is meant by this distinction is that heterosexual
normativity ought not to order gender, and that such ordering ought to
be opposed, I am firmly in favor of this view.4 If, however, what is
meant by this is that (descriptively speaking), there is no sexual regulation of gender, then I think an important, but not exclusive, dimension
of how homophobia works is going unrecognized by those who are
clearly most eager to combat it. It is important for me to concede,
however, that the performance of gender subversion can indicate nothing about sexuality or sexual practice. Gender can be rendered
ambiguous without disturbing or reorienting normative sexuality at
all. Sometimes gender ambiguity can operate precisely to contain or
deflect non-normative sexual practice and thereby work to keep normative sexuality intact.5 Thus, no correlation can be drawn, for
instance, between drag or transgender and sexual practice, and the distribution of hetero-, bi-, and homo-inclinations cannot be predictably
mapped onto the travels of gender bending or changing.
Much of my work in recent years has been devoted to clarifying
and revising the theory of performativity that is outlined in Gender
Trouble.6 It is difficult to say precisely what performativity is not only
because my own views on what “performativity” might mean have
changed over time, most often in response to excellent criticisms,7 but
because so many others have taken it up and given it their own formulations. I originally took my clue on how to read the performativity of
gender from Jacques Derrida’s reading of Kafka’s “Before the Law.”
There the one who waits for the law, sits before the door of the law,
attributes a certain force to the law for which one waits.The anticipation of an </span><span class="c-2">authoritative disclosure of meaning is the </span><span class="c-3">means by which
that authority is attributed and installed: the anticipation conjures </span><span class="c-1">its
object.</span><span class="c-0"> I wondered whether we do not labor under a similar expectation concerning </span><span class="c-1">gender, that it operates as an interior essence that
might be disclosed, an expectation that ends up producing the very
phenomenon </span><span class="c-0">that it anticipates. In the </span><span class="c-2">first instance, then, the </span><span class="c-3">performativity of gender revolves around this metalepsis, the way in which
~
the anticipation of a gendered essence produces that which it posits as
outside itself. Secondly, </span><span class="c-4">performativity is not a singular act, but a </span><span class="c-5">repetition </span><span class="c-4">and a ritual, which achieves its </span><span class="c-5">effects through its naturalization
in the context of a body, understood, in part, as a culturally sustained
temporal </span><span class="c-4">duration.</span><span class="c-0">8
Several important questions have been posed to this doctrine, and
one seems especially noteworthy to mention here.The </span><span class="c-1">view that </span><span class="c-2">gender
is performative sought to show that what we </span><span class="c-4">take to be an internal
essence of gender is </span><span class="c-5">manufactured through a sustained set of acts, posited through the gendered stylization </span><span class="c-4">of the body.</span><span class="c-1"> In this way, it showed
that what we take to be an “internal” feature of ourselves is one that we
anticipate and produce through certain bodily acts,</span><span class="c-0"> at an extreme, an
hallucinatory effect of naturalized gestures. Does this mean that everything that is understood as “internal” about the psyche is therefore evacuated, and that internality is a false metaphor? Although Gender Trouble
clearly drew upon the metaphor of an internal psyche in its early discussion of gender melancholy, that emphasis was not brought forward into
the thinking of performativity itself.9 Both The Psychic Life of Power and
several of my recent articles on psychoanalytic topics have sought to
come to terms with this problem, what many have seen as a problematic
break between the early and later chapters of this book. Although I
would deny that all of the internal world of the psyche is but an effect of
a stylized set of acts, I </span><span class="c-1">continue to think that it is a significant theoretical
mistake to take the “internality” of the psychic world for granted.</span><span class="c-0">
Certain features of the world, including people we know and lose, do
become “internal” features of the self, but they are transformed through
that interiorization, and that inner world, as the Kleinians call it, is constituted precisely as a consequence of the interiorizations that a psyche
performs. This suggests that there may well be a psychic theory of performativity at work that calls for greater exploration.
Although this text does not answer the question of whether the
materiality of the body is fully constructed, that has been the focus of
much of my subsequent work, which I hope will prove clarifying for the
~
reader.10 The question of whether or not the theory of performativity
can be transposed onto matters of race has been explored by several
scholars.11 I would note here not only that racial presumptions invariably underwrite the discourse on gender in ways that need to be made
explicit, but that race and gender ought not to be treated as simple
analogies. I would therefore suggest that the question to ask is not
whether the theory of performativity is transposable onto race, but
what happens to the theory when it tries to come to grips with race.
Many of these debates have centered on the status of “construction,”
whether race is constructed in the same way as gender. My view is that
no single account of construction will do, and that these </span><span class="c-1">categories
always work as </span><span class="c-2">background for one another, and they often find their
most powerful articulation </span><span class="c-1">through one another.</span><span class="c-0">Thus, the sexualization
of racial gender norms calls to be read through multiple lenses at once,
and the analysis surely illuminates the limits of gender as an exclusive
category of analysis.12
Although I’ve enumerated some of the academic traditions and
debates that have animated this book, it is not my purpose to offer a
full apologia in these brief pages.There is one aspect of the conditions
of its production that is not always understood about the text: it was
produced not merely from the </span><span class="c-1">academy, but from convergent social
movements of which I have been a part, and within the context of a
lesbian and gay community on the east coast of the United States in
which I lived for fourteen years prior to the writing of this </span><span class="c-0">book.
Despite the dislocation of the subject that the text performs, there is a
person here: I went to many meetings, bars, and marches and saw
many kinds of genders, understood myself to be at the crossroads of
some of them, and encountered sexuality at several of its cultural
edges. I knew many people who were trying to find their way in the
midst of a significant movement for sexual recognition and freedom,
and felt the exhilaration and frustration that goes along with being a
part of that movement both in its hopefulness and internal dissension.
At the same time that I was ensconced in the academy, I was also living
~
a life outside those walls, and though Gender Trouble is an academic
book, it began, for me, with a crossing-over, sitting on Rehoboth
Beach, wondering whether I could link the different sides of my life.
That I can write in an autobiographical mode does not, I think, relocate this <a name="b-2"></a>subject that I am, but perhaps it gives the reader a sense of
solace that there is someone here (I will suspend for the moment the
problem that this someone is given in language).
It has been one of the most gratifying experiences for me that the
text continues to move outside the academy to this day. At the same
time that the book was taken up by Queer Nation, and some of its
reflections on the theatricality of queer self-presentation resonated
with the tactics of Act Up, it was among the materials that also helped
to prompt members of the American Psychoanalytic Association and
the American Psychological Association to reassess some of their current doxa on homosexuality. The questions of performative gender
were appropriated in different ways in the visual arts, at Whitney exhibitions, and at the Otis School for the Arts in Los Angeles, among others. Some of its formulations on the subject of “women” and the
relation between sexuality and gender also made its way into feminist
jurisprudence and antidiscrimination legal scholarship in the work of
Vicki Schultz, Katherine Franke, and Mary Jo Frug.
In turn, I have been compelled to revise some of my positions in
Gender Trouble by virtue of my own political engagements. In the </span><span class="c-1">book, I
tend to conceive of the claim of “universality” in exclusive negative and
exclusionary terms. However, I came to see the term has important
strategic use precisely as a non-</span><span class="c-0">substantial and open-ended category as I
worked with an extraordinary group of activists first as a board member and then as board chair of the International Gay and Lesbian Human
Rights Commission (1994–7), an organization that represents sexual
minorities on a broad range of human rights issues. There I </span><span class="c-1">came to
understand how the assertion of universality can be </span><span class="c-2">proleptic and </span><span class="c-3">performative, conjuring a reality that does not yet exist, and holding out
the possibility for a convergence of cultural horizons that have not yet
~
met.</span><span class="c-2"> Thus, I arrived at a second view of universality in which it is
defined as a future-oriented labor of cultural translation.</span><span class="c-0">13 More
recently, I have been compelled to relate my work to political theory
and, once again, to the concept of universality in a co-authored book
that I am writing with Ernesto Laclau and Slavoj Žižek on the theory of
hegemony and its implications for a theoretically activist Left (to be
published by Verso in 2000).
Another practical dimension of my thinking has taken place in
relationship to psychoanalysis as both a scholarly and clinical enterprise. I am currently working with a group of progressive psychoanalytic therapists on a new journal, Studies in Gender and Sexuality, that
seeks to bring clinical and scholarly work into productive dialogue on
questions of sexuality, gender, and culture.
Both critics and friends of Gender Trouble have drawn attention to
the difficulty of its style. It is no doubt strange, and maddening to
some, to find a book that is not easily consumed to be “popular”
according to academic standards. The surprise over this is perhaps
attributable to the way we underestimate the reading public, its capacity and desire for reading complicated and challenging texts, when the
complication is not gratuitous, when the challenge is in the service of
</span><span class="c-1">calling taken-for-granted truths into question, when the taken for
grantedness of those truths is, indeed, oppressive.</span><span class="c-0">
I </span><span class="c-1">think that style is a complicated terrain, and not one that we unilaterally choose or control with the purposes we consciously intend.</span><span class="c-0">
Fredric Jameson made this clear in his early book on Sartre. Certainly,
one can practice styles, but the styles that become available to you are
not entirely a matter of choice. Moreover, neither grammar nor style
are politically neutral. Learning the rules that govern intelligible
speech is an inculcation into normalized language, where the price of
not conforming is the loss of intelligibility itself. As Drucilla Cornell,
in the tradition of Adorno, reminds me: there is nothing radical about
common sense. It </span><span class="c-3">would be a mistake to think that received grammar
is the best vehicle for expressing radical views, given the constraints
</span><span class="c-2">~
that grammar imposes upon thought, indeed, upon </span><span class="c-1">the thinkable </span><span class="c-0">itself.
But formulations that twist grammar or that implicitly call into question the </span><span class="c-1">subject-verb requirements of propositional sense are clearly
irritating </span><span class="c-0">for some. They produce more work for their readers, and
sometimes their </span><span class="c-1">readers are offended by such demands. Are those who
are offended making a legitimate request for “plain speaking” or does
their complaint emerge from a consumer expectation of intellectual
life?</span><span class="c-0"> Is there, perhaps, a value to be derived from such experiences of
linguistic difficulty? If gender itself is naturalized through grammatical
norms, as Monique Wittig has argued, then the </span><span class="c-1">alteration of gender at
the most fundamental epistemic level will be conducted, in part,
through contesting the grammar in which gender is given.</span><span class="c-0">
The </span><span class="c-1">demand for lucidity forgets the ruses that motor the ostensibly “clear” view. Avital Ronell recalls the moment in which Nixon
looked into the eyes of the nation and said, “let me make one thing
perfectly clear” and then proceeded to lie. What </span><span class="c-3">travels under the
sign of “clarity,” and what would be the price of failing to deploy a certain critical suspicion when the arrival of lucidity is announced?</span><span class="c-1"> Who
devises the protocols of “clarity” and whose interests do they serve?
What is foreclosed by the insistence on parochial standards of transparency as requisite for all communication? What does “transparency”
keep obscure?</span><span class="c-0">
I </span><span class="c-1">grew up understanding something of the violence of gender
norms: an uncle incarcerated for his anatomically anomalous body,
deprived of family and friends, living out his days in an “institute” in the
Kansas prairies; gay cousins forced to leave their homes because of their
sexuality, real and imagined; my own tempestuous coming out at the
age of 16; and a subsequent adult landscape of lost jobs, lovers, and
homes. All of this subjected me to strong and scarring condemnation
but, luckily, did not prevent me from pursuing pleasure and insisting on
a legitimating recognition for my sexual life. It was difficult to bring this
violence into view precisely because gender was so taken for granted at
the same time that it was violently policed. It was assumed either to be
~
a natural manifestation of sex or a cultural constant that no human
agency could hope to revise. I also came to understand something of the
violence of the foreclosed life, the one that does not get named as “living,” the one whose incarceration implies a suspension of life, or a sustained death sentence.</span><span class="c-0">The dogged effort to “denaturalize” gender in this
text emerges, I think, from a strong desire both to counter the normative violence implied by ideal morphologies of sex and to uproot the
pervasive assumptions about natural or presumptive heterosexuality
that are informed by ordinary and academic discourses on sexuality.The
writing of this denaturalization was not done simply out of a desire to
play with language or prescribe theatrical antics in the place of “real”
politics, as some critics have conjectured (as if theatre and politics are
always distinct). It was done from a desire to live, to make life possible,
and to rethink the possible as such. What would the world have to be
like for my uncle to live in the company of family, friends, or extended
kinship of some other kind? How must we rethink the ideal morphological constraints upon the human such that those who fail to approximate
the norm are not condemned to a death within life?14
Some readers have asked whether Gender Trouble seeks to expand the
realm of gender possibilities for a reason. They ask, for what purpose
are such new configurations of gender devised, and how ought we to
judge among them? The question often involves a prior premise, namely, that the text does not address the normative or prescriptive dimension of feminist thought. “Normative” clearly has at least two meanings
in this critical encounter, since the word is one I use often, mainly to
describe the </span><span class="c-1">mundane violence performed by certain kinds of gender
ideals.</span><span class="c-0"> I usually use “normative” in a way that is synonymous with “pertaining to the norms that govern gender.” But the term “normative” also
</span><span class="c-3">pertains to ethical justification, how it is established, and what concrete
consequences proceed therefrom.</span><span class="c-0"> One critical question posed of Gender
Trouble has been: how do we proceed to make judgments on how gender
is to be lived on the basis of the theoretical descriptions offered here? It
is not possible to oppose the “normative” forms of gender without at the
~
same time subscribing to a certain normative view of how the gendered
world ought to be. I want to suggest, however, that the positive normative vision of this text, such as it is, does not and cannot take the form of
a prescription: “subvert gender in the way that I say, and life will be
good.”
Those who make such prescriptions or who are willing to decide
between subversive and unsubversive expressions of gender, base their
judgments on a description. Gender appears in this or that form, and
then a normative judgment is made about those appearances and on
the basis of what appears. But what conditions the domain of appearance for gender itself? We may be tempted to make the following distinction: a descriptive account of gender includes considerations of what
makes gender intelligible, an inquiry into its conditions of possibility,
whereas a normative account seeks to answer the question of which
expressions of gender are acceptable, and which are not, supplying
persuasive reasons to distinguish between such expressions in this way.
The question, however, of what qualifies as “gender” is itself already a
question that attests to a pervasively normative operation of power, a
fugitive operation of “what will be the case” under the rubric of “what
is the case.” Thus, the very description of the field of gender is no sense
prior to, or separable from, the question of its normative operation.
I am not interested in delivering judgments on what distinguishes
the subversive from the unsubversive. Not only do I believe that such
judgments cannot be made out of context, but that they cannot be
made in ways that endure through time (“contexts” are themselves
posited unities that undergo temporal change and expose their essential disunity). Just as metaphors lose their metaphoricity as they congeal through time into concepts, so subversive performances always
run the risk of becoming deadening cliches through their repetition
and, most importantly, through their repetition within commodity
culture where “subversion” carries market value. The effort to name
the criterion for subversiveness will always fail, and ought to. So what
is<a name="b-3"></a> at stake in using the term at all?
~
What continues to concern me most is the following kinds of
questions: what will and will not constitute an intelligible life, and
how do presumptions about normative gender and sexuality determine in advance what will qualify as the “human” and the “livable”? In
other words, how do </span><span class="c-1">normative gender presumptions work to delimit
the very field of description that we have for the human? What is the
means by which we come to see this delimiting power, and what are
the means by which we transform </span><span class="c-0">it?
The discussion of drag that Gender Trouble offers to explain the constructed and </span><span class="c-1">performative dimension of gender is not precisely an example of subversion. It would be a mistake to take </span><span class="c-0">it as the paradigm of
subversive action or, indeed, as a model for political agency.The </span><span class="c-1">point is
rather different. If one </span><span class="c-2">thinks that one sees a man dressed as a woman or
a woman dressed as a man, then one takes the first term of each of those
perceptions as the “reality” of gender:</span><span class="c-1"> the gender that is introduced
through the simile lacks “reality,” and is taken to constitute an illusory
appearance. In such perceptions in which an ostensible reality is coupled with an unreality, we think we know what the reality is, and take
the secondary appearance of gender to be mere artifice, play, falsehood,
and illusion.</span><span class="c-0"> But what is the sense of “gender reality” that founds this
perception in this way? Perhaps we think we know what the anatomy of
the person is (sometimes we do not, and we certainly have not appreciated the variation that exists at the level of anatomical description). Or
we derive that knowledge from the </span><span class="c-1">clothes that the person wears, or
how the clothes are worn.This is naturalized knowledge, even though it
is based on a series of cultural </span><span class="c-0">inferences, some of which are highly
erroneous. Indeed, if we </span><span class="c-1">shift the example from drag to transsexuality,
then it is no longer possible to derive a judgment about stable anatomy
from the clothes that cover and articulate the body. That body may be
preoperative, transitional, or postoperative; even “seeing” the body may
not answer the question: for what are the categories through which one sees?
The moment in which one’s staid and usual cultural perceptions fail,

~
when one cannot with surety read the body that one sees, is precisely
the moment when one is no longer sure whether the body encountered
is that of a man or a woman.</span><span class="c-0"> The vacillation between the categories
itself constitutes the experience of the body in question.
When such categories come into question, the reality of gender is
also put into crisis: it becomes unclear how to distinguish the real from
the unreal. And this is the occasion in which we come to understand
that what we take to be “real,” what we invoke as the naturalized
knowledge of gender is, in fact, a changeable and revisable reality. Call
it subversive or call it something else. Although this insight does not in
itself constitute a political revolution, no political revolution is possible without a radical shift in one’s notion of the possible and the real.
And sometimes this shift comes as a result of certain kinds of practices
that precede their explicit theorization, and which prompt a rethinking of our basic categories: what is gender, how is it produced and
reproduced, what are its possibilities? At this point, the sedimented
and reified field of gender “reality” is understood as one that might be
made differently and, indeed, less violently.
The point of this text is not to celebrate drag as the expression of a
true and model gender (even as it is important to resist the belittling
of drag that sometimes takes place), but to </span><span class="c-1">show that the naturalized
knowledge of gender operates as a preemptive and violent circumscription of reality.</span><span class="c-0">To the extent the gender norms (ideal dimorphism,
</span><span class="c-1">heterosexual complementarity of bodies, ideals and rule of proper and
improper masculinity and femininity,</span><span class="c-0"> many of which are underwritten
by racial codes of purity and taboos against miscegenation) </span><span class="c-1">establish
what will and will not be intelligibly human, what will and will not be
considered to be “real,” they establish the ontological field in which
bodies may be given </span><span class="c-0">legitimate expression. If there is a positive normative task in Gender Trouble, it is to insist upon the extension of this
legitimacy to bodies that have been regarded as false, unreal, and unintelligible. Drag is an example that is meant to establish that “reality” is

~
not as fixed as we generally assume it to be.The purpose of the example is to expose the tenuousness of gender “reality” in order to counter
the violence performed by gender norms.
In this text as elsewhere I have tried to understand what political agency might be, given that it cannot be isolated from the dynamics of power from which it is wrought.The iterability of performativity is a theory of agency, one that cannot disavow power as the
condition of its own possibility. This text does not sufficiently explain
performativity in terms of its social, psychic, corporeal, and temporal
dimensions. In some ways, the continuing work of that clarification, in
response to numerous excellent criticisms, guides most of my subsequent publications.
Other concerns have emerged over this text in the last decade, and
I have sought to answer them through various publications. On the status of the materiality of the body, I have offered a reconsideration and
revision of my views in Bodies that Matter. On the question of the necessity of the category of “women” for feminist analysis, I have revised and
expanded my views in “Contingent Foundations” to be found in the
volume I coedited with Joan W. Scott, Feminists Theorize the Political
(Routledge, 1993) and in the collectively authored Feminist Contentions
(Routledge, 1995).
I do not </span><span class="c-2">believe that poststructuralism entails the death of autobiographical writing, but it does draw attention to the difficulty of the “I”
to express itself through the language that is available </span><span class="c-0">to it. For this “I”
that you read is in part a consequence of the grammar that governs the
availability of persons in language. I am not outside the language that
structures me, but neither am I determined by the language that makes
this “I” possible. This is the bind of self-expression, as I understand it.
What it means is that you never receive me apart from the grammar
that establishes my availability to you. If I treat that grammar as pellucid, then I fail to call attention precisely to that sphere of language that
establishes and disestablishes intelligibility, and that would be precisely
~
to thwart my own project as I have described it to you here. I am not
trying to be difficult, but only to draw attention to a difficulty without
which no “I” can appear.
This difficulty takes on a specific dimension when approached from
a psychoanalytic perspective. In my efforts to understand the opacity of
the “I” in language, I have turned increasingly to psychoanalysis since the
publication of Gender Trouble. The usual effort to polarize the theory
of the psyche from the theory of power seems to me to be counterproductive, for part of what is so oppressive about social forms of gender is the psychic difficulties they produce. I sought to consider the
ways in which Foucault and psychoanalysis might be thought together in
The Psychic Life of Power (Stanford, 1997). I have also made use of psychoanalysis to curb the occasional voluntarism of my view of performativity without thereby undermining a more general theory of agency.
Gender Trouble sometimes reads as if gender is simply a self-invention or
that the psychic meaning of a gendered presentation might be read
directly off its surface. Both of those postulates have had to be refined
over time. Moreover, my theory </span><span class="c-3">sometimes waffles between understanding performativity as linguistic and casting it as theatrical. I have
come to think that the two are invariably related, chiasmically so, and
that a reconsideration of the speech act as an instance of power invariably draws attention to both its theatrical and linguistic dimensions.</span><span class="c-1"> In
Excitable Speech, I sought to show that the </span><span class="c-3">speech act is at once performed (and thus theatrical, presented to an audience, subject to interpretation), and linguistic, inducing a set of effects through its implied
relation to linguistic conventions.</span><span class="c-2"> If one wonders </span><span class="c-0">how a linguistic theory of the speech act relates to bodily gestures, one need only consider
that speech itself is a bodily act with specific linguistic consequences.
Thus speech belongs exclusively neither to corporeal presentation nor
to language, and its status as word and deed is necessarily ambiguous.
This ambiguity has consequences for the practice of coming out, for the
insurrectionary power of the speech act, for language as a condition of
both bodily seduction and the threat of injury.
~
If I were to rewrite this book under present circumstances, I would
include a discussion of transgender and intersexuality, the way that ideal
gender dimorphism works in both sorts of discourses, the different relations to surgical intervention that these related concerns sustain. I
would also include a discussion on racialized sexuality and, in particular,
how taboos against miscegenation (and the romanticization of crossracial sexual exchange) are essential to the naturalized and denaturalized
forms that gender takes. I continue to hope for a coalition of sexual
minorities that will transcend the simple categories of identity, that will
refuse the erasure of bisexuality, that will counter and dissipate the violence imposed by restrictive bodily norms. I would hope that such a
coalition would be based on the irreducible complexity of sexuality and
its implication in various dynamics of discursive and institutional power,
and that no one will be too quick to reduce power to hierarchy and to
refuse its productive political dimensions. Even as I think that gaining
recognition for one’s status as a sexual minority is a difficult task within
reigning discourses of law, politics, and language, I continue to consider
it a necessity for survival.The mobilization of identity categories for the
purposes of politicization always remain threatened by the prospect of
identity becoming an instrument of the power one opposes. That is no
reason not to use, and be used, by identity.There is no political position
purified of power, and perhaps that impurity is what produces agency as
the potential interruption and reversal of regulatory regimes. Those
who are deemed “unreal” nevertheless lay hold of the real, a laying hold
that happens in concert, and a vital instability is produced by that performative surprise.This book is written then as part of the cultural life
of a collective struggle that has had, and will continue to have, some success in increasing the possibilities f<a name="b-4"></a>or a livable life for those who live, or
try to live, on the sexual margins.15

</span><span class="c-2">Contemporary feminist debates over the meanings of gender lead time
and again to a </span><span class="c-3">certain sense of trouble, as if the </span><span class="c-4">indeterminacy of gender might eventually culminate in the failure of feminism.</span><span class="c-1"> Perhaps
trouble need not carry such a negative valence.</span><span class="c-0"> To </span><span class="c-3">make trouble was,
within the reigning discourse of my childhood, </span><span class="c-4">something one should
never do precisely because that would get one in trouble.The rebellion
and its reprimand seemed </span><span class="c-3">to be caught up in the same terms, a phenomenon that gave rise to my first critical insight into the subtle ruse of
power: the </span><span class="c-5">prevailing law threatened one with trouble, even put one in
trouble, all to keep one out of trouble. Hence, I concluded that </span><span class="c-6">trouble
is inevitable and the task, how best to make it, what best way </span><span class="c-0">to be in it.
As time went by, further ambiguities arrived on the critical scene. I
noted that trouble sometimes euphemized some fundamentally mysterious problem usually related to the alleged mystery of all things feminine. I read Beauvoir who explained that to be a woman within the
terms of a masculinist culture is to be a source of mystery and
unknowability for men, and this seemed confirmed somehow when I
read Sartre for whom all desire, problematically presumed as heterosexual and masculine, was defined as trouble. For that masculine subject
of desire, </span><span class="c-1">trouble became a scandal with the sudden intrusion, the
unanticipated agency, of a female “object” who inexplicably </span><span class="c-2">returns the
glance, reverses the gaze, and contests the place and authority of the
~
masculine position.</span><span class="c-0">The </span><span class="c-2">radical dependency of the masculine subject on
the female “Other” suddenly exposes his autonomy as illusory.</span><span class="c-1">That particular dialectical reversal of power, however, couldn’t quite hold my
attention—although others surely did. </span><span class="c-2">Power seemed to be more than
an exchange between subjects or a relation of constant </span><span class="c-1">inversion
between and subject and an Other; indeed, power appeared to operate
in the production of that very binary frame for thinking about gender. I
asked, what configuration of power constructs the subject and the
Other, that binary relation between “men” and “women,” and the internal stability of those terms?</span><span class="c-0"> What restriction is here at work? Are those
terms untroubling only to the extent that they conform to a heterosexual matrix for conceptualizing gender and desire? What </span><span class="c-4">happens to the
subject and to the stability of gender categories when the epistemic
regime of presumptive heterosexuality is unmasked as that which produces and reifies these ostensible categories of ontology?</span><span class="c-0">
But how can an epistemic/ontological regime be brought into
question? What </span><span class="c-1">best way to </span><span class="c-4">trouble the </span><span class="c-5">gender categories that support
gender hierarchy and compulsory heterosexuality?</span><span class="c-0"> Consider the fate of
“female trouble,” that historical configuration of a nameless female
indisposition, which thinly veiled the notion that being female is a natural indisposition. Serious as the medicalization of women’s bodies is,
the term is also laughable, and </span><span class="c-1">laughter in the face of serious categories
is indispensable for feminism.Without a doubt, feminism continues to
require its own forms of serious play.</span><span class="c-0"> Female Trouble is also the title of
the John Waters film that features Divine, the hero/heroine of Hairspray as well, </span><span class="c-1">whose impersonation of </span><span class="c-2">women implicitly suggests that
</span><span class="c-3">gender is a kind of persistent impersonation that passes as the real.</span><span class="c-1">
Her/his </span><span class="c-3">performance </span><span class="c-6">destabilizes the very distinctions between the
natural and the artificial, depth and surface,</span><span class="c-5"> inner and outer through
which discourse about genders almost always operates.</span><span class="c-1"> Is drag the imitation of gender, or does it dramatize the signifying gestures through
which gender itself is established?</span><span class="c-0"> Does being female constitute a “natural fact” or a cultural performance, or is “naturalness” </span><span class="c-2">constituted
~
through discursively constrained performative acts that produce the
body through and within the categories of sex?</span><span class="c-0"> Divine notwithstanding, </span><span class="c-1">gender practices within gay and lesbian cultures often thematize
“the natural” in parodic contexts that bring into relief the performative
construction of an original and true sex.</span><span class="c-0">What other foundational categories of identity—the binary of sex, gender, and the body—can be
shown as productions that create the effect of the natural, the original,
and the inevitable?
To expose the foundational categories of sex, gender, and desire as
effects of a specific formation of power requires a form of critical
inquiry that Foucault, reformulating Nietzsche, designates as “genealogy.” A </span><span class="c-4">genealogical critique </span><span class="c-5">refuses to </span><span class="c-7">search for the origins of gender, the inner truth of female desire, a genuine or authentic sexual
identity that repression has kept from view;</span><span class="c-5"> rather, genealogy </span><span class="c-11">investigates the </span><span class="c-12">political stakes in </span><span class="c-13">designating as an origin and cause those </span><span class="c-15">identity categories that are in fact the </span><span class="c-18">effects of institutions,</span><span class="c-17"> practices,</span><span class="c-16">
discourses with multiple and diffuse points of origin.</span><span class="c-2"> The task </span><span class="c-0">of this
inquiry is to </span><span class="c-1">center on—and decenter—such defining institutions:
phallogocentrism and compulsory heterosexuality.</span><span class="c-0">
Precisely because “female” no longer appears to be a stable notion,
its meaning is as troubled and unfixed as “woman,” and because both
terms gain their troubled significations only as relational terms, this
inquiry takes as its focus gender and the relational analysis it suggests.
Further, it is no </span><span class="c-4">longer clear that feminist theory ought to try to settle
the </span><span class="c-5">questions of primary identity in order to get on with the task of
politics. Instead, we ought to ask, what political possibilities are the
consequence of a radical critique of the categories of identity.</span><span class="c-3"> What
new shape of politics emerges when identity as a common ground no
longer constrains the discourse on feminist politics? And to what
</span><span class="c-4">extent does the effort to locate a common identity as the </span><span class="c-5">foundation
for a feminist politics preclude a radical inquiry into the political construction </span><span class="c-4">and regulation of identity </span><span class="c-0">itself?

This text is divided into three chapters that effect a critical genealogy of
gender categories in very different discursive domains. Chapter 1,
“Subjects of Sex/Gender/Desire,” reconsiders the status of “women” as
the subject of feminism and the sex/gender distinction. Compulsory
heterosexuality and phallogocentrism are understood as regimes of
power/discourse with often divergent ways of answering central question of gender discourse: how does language construct the categories of
sex? Does “the feminine” resist representation within language? Is language understood as phallogocentric (Luce Irigaray’s question)? Is “the
feminine” the only sex represented within a language that conflates the
female and the sexual (Monique Wittig’s contention)? Where and how
do compulsory heterosexuality and phallogocentrism converge? Where
are the points of breakage between? How does language itself produce
the fiction construction of “sex” that supports these various regimes of
power? Within a language of presumptive heterosexuality, what sorts of
continuities are assumed to exist among sex, gender, and desire? Are
these terms discrete? What </span><span class="c-3">kinds of cultural practices produce subversive discontinuity and dissonance among sex, gender, and desire and call
into question their alleged relations?</span><span class="c-0">
Chapter 2, “Prohibition, Psychoanalysis, and the Production of the
Heterosexual Matrix,” offers a selective reading of structuralism, psychoanalytic and feminist accounts of the incest taboo as the mechanism
that tries to enforce discrete and internally coherent gender identities
within a heterosexual frame. The question of homosexuality is, within
some psychoanalytic discourse, invariably associated with forms of
cultural unintelligibility and, in the case of lesbianism, with the desexualization of the female body. On the other hand, the uses of psychoanalytic theory for an account of complex gender “identities” is pursued
through an analysis of identity, identification, and masquerade in Joan
Riviere and other psychoanalytic literature. Once the incest taboo is
subjected to Foucault’s critique of the repressive hypothesis in The
History of Sexuality, that prohibitive or juridical structure is shown
both to instate compulsory heterosexuality within a masculinist sexual
~
economy and to enable a critical challenge to that economy. Is psychoanalysis an antifoundationalist inquiry that affirms the kind of sexual
complexity that effectively deregulates rigid and hierarchical sexual
codes, or does it maintain an unacknowledged set of assumptions about
the foundations of identity that work in favor of those very hierarchies?
The last chapter, “Subversive Bodily Acts,” begins with a critical
consideration of the construction of the maternal body in Julia Kristeva
in order to show the implicit norms that govern the cultural intelligibility of sex and sexuality in her work.Although Foucault is engaged
to provide a critique of Kristeva, a close examination of some of
Foucault’s own work reveals a problematic indifference to sexual difference. His critique of the category of sex, however, provides an
insight into the regulatory practices of some contemporary medical fictions designed to designate univocal sex. Monique Wittig’s theory and
fiction propose a “disintegration” of culturally constituted bodies, suggesting that morphology itself is a consequence of a hegemonic conceptual scheme. The final section of this chapter, “Bodily Inscriptions,
Performative Subversions,” considers the boundary and surface of bodies as politically constructed, drawing on the work of Mary Douglas
and Julia Kristeva.As a strategy to denaturalize and resignify bodily categories, I describe and propose a </span><span class="c-2">set of parodic practices based in a performative theory of gender acts that </span><span class="c-4">disrupt the categories of the body,
sex, gender, and sexuality and occasion their subversive resignification
and proliferation beyond the binary </span><span class="c-2">frame.</span><span class="c-0">
It seems that every text has more sources than it can reconstruct within
its own terms. These are sources that define and inform the very language of the text in ways that would require a thorough unraveling of
the text itself to be understood, and of course there would be no guarantee that that unraveling would ever stop. Although I have offered a
childhood story to begin this preface, it is a fable irreducible to fact.
Indeed, the purpose here more generally is to </span><span class="c-3">trace the way in which
gender fables establish and circulate the misnomer of natural facts.</span><span class="c-0"> It is
~
clearly impossible to recover the origins of these essays, to locate the
various moments that have enabled this text. The texts are assembled
to facilitate a political convergence of feminism, gay and lesbian perspectives on gender, and poststructuralist theory. Philosophy is the
pre<a name="b-5"></a>dominant disciplinary mechanism that currently mobilizes this
author-subject, although it rarely if ever appears separated from other
discourses. This inquiry seeks to affirm those positions on the critical
boundaries of disciplinary life. The point is not to stay marginal, but to
participate in whatever network or marginal zones is spawned from
other disciplinary centers and that, together, constitute a multiple displacement of those authorities. The complexity of gender requires an
interdisciplinary and postdisciplinary set of discourses in order to resist
the domestication of gender studies or women studies within the academy and to radicalize the notion of feminist critique.
The writing of this text was made possible by a number of institutional and individual forms of support. The American Council of
Learned Societies provided a Recent Recipient of the Ph.D. Fellowship
for the fall of 1987, and the </span><span class="c-3">School of Social Science at the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton </span><span class="c-0">provided fellowship, housing, and
provocative argumentation during the 1987–1988 academic year. The
George Washington University Faculty Research Grant also supported
my research during the summers of 1987 and 1988. Joan W. Scott has
been an invaluable and incisive critic throughout various stages of this
manuscript. Her commitment to a critical rethinking of the presuppositional terms of feminist politics has challenged and inspired me. The
“Gender Seminar” assembled at the Institute for Advanced Study under
Joan Scott’s direction helped me to clarify and elaborate my views by
virtue of the significant and provocative divisions in our collective
thinking. Hence, I thank Lila Abu-Lughod, Yasmine Ergas, Donna
Haraway, Evelyn Fox Keller, Dorinne Kondo, Rayna Rapp, Carroll
Smith-Rosenberg, Louise Tilly. My students in the seminar “Gender,
Identity, and Desire,” offered at Wesleyan University and at Yale in 1985
and 1986, respectively, were indispensable for their willingness to
~
imagine alternatively gendered worlds. I also appreciate the variety of
critical responses that I received on presentations of parts of this work
from the Princeton Women’s Studies Colloquium, the Humanities
Center at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Notre Dame, the
University of Kansas, Amherst College, and the Yale University School
of Medicine. My acknowledgment also goes to Linda Singer, whose persistent radicalism has been invaluable, Sandra Bartky for her work and
her timely words of encouragement, Linda Nicholson for her editorial
and critical advice, and Linda Anderson for her acute political intuitions. I also thank the following individuals, friends, and colleagues
who shaped and supported my thinking: Eloise Moore Aggar, Inés Azar,
Peter Caws, Nancy F. Cott, Kathy Natanson, Lois Natanson, Maurice
Natanson, Stacy Pies, Josh Shapiro, Margaret Soltan, Robert V. Stone,
Richard Vann, and Eszti Votaw. I thank Sandra Schmidt for her fine work
in helping to prepare this manuscript, and Meg Gilbert for her assistance. I also thank Maureen MacGrogan for encouraging this project
and others with her humor, patience, and fine editorial guidance.
As before, I thank Wendy Owen for her relentless imagination,
keen criticism, and for the provocation of her work.

i. “Women” as the Subject of Feminism
For the most </span><span class="c-6">part, </span><span class="c-7">feminist theory has assumed that </span><span class="c-9">there is some
existing identity, understood through the category of women,</span><span class="c-7"> who not
only initiates feminist interests and goals within discourse, but constitutes the subject for whom political representation </span><span class="c-6">is pursued.</span><span class="c-4"> But politics and representation are controversial terms.</span><span class="c-3"> On the one </span><span class="c-4">hand,
representation </span><span class="c-5">serves as the operative term within a political process
that seeks to extend visibility and legitimacy to women as political
subjects; on the other hand, representation is the normative function
of a language which is said either to reveal or to distort what is
~
assumed to be true about the category of women.</span><span class="c-0"> For feminist theory,
the development of a language that fully or adequately represents
women has seemed necessary to foster the political visibility of
women. This has seemed obviously important considering the pervasive cultural condition in which women’s lives were either misrepresented or not represented at all.
Recently, this prevailing conception of the relation between feminist theory and politics has come under challenge from within feminist
discourse.The very </span><span class="c-3">subject of women is no longer understood in stable
or abiding terms.</span><span class="c-0"> There is a great deal of material that not only questions the viability of “the subject” as the ultimate candidate for representation or, indeed, liberation, but there is very little agreement after
all on what it is that constitutes, or ought to constitute, the category of
women.The domains of political and linguistic “</span><span class="c-1">representation” </span><span class="c-3">set out
in advance the criterion by which subjects themselves are formed,</span><span class="c-2">
with the result that representation is extended only to what can be
acknowledged as a subject.</span><span class="c-0"> In other words, the </span><span class="c-1">qualifications for being
a subject must first be met before representation can be extended.</span><span class="c-0">
</span><span class="c-2">Foucault points out that </span><span class="c-5">juridical systems of power produce the subjects they subsequently come </span><span class="c-4">to represent.</span><span class="c-3">1 Juridical </span><span class="c-2">notions of power
appear to regulate political life in purely negative terms—</span><span class="c-1">that is,
through the limitation, prohibition, regulation, control, and even “protection” of individuals related to that political structure through the
contingent and retractable operation of choice. But the </span><span class="c-2">subjects regulated by such structures are, by virtue of being subjected to them,
</span><span class="c-3">formed, defined, and reproduced in accordance with the requirements
of those </span><span class="c-2">structures.</span><span class="c-1"> If this analysis is right, then the juridical formation
of language and politics that represents women as “the subject” of feminism is itself a discursive </span><span class="c-2">formation and effect of a given version of
representational politics. And the </span><span class="c-3">feminist subject </span><span class="c-5">turns out to be discursively constituted by the very political system that is supposed to
facilitate </span><span class="c-4">its emancipation.</span><span class="c-1"> This becomes politically problematic if that
system can be shown to produce gendered subjects along a differential
~
axis of domination or to produce subjects who are presumed to be
masculine.</span><span class="c-0"> In such cases, an uncritical appeal to such a system for the
emancipation of “women” will be clearly self-defeating.
The </span><span class="c-2">question of “the subject” is crucial for politics, and for feminist
politics in particular, because juridical subjects are invariably produced
through certain exclusionary practices that do not “show” once the
juridical structure of politics </span><span class="c-1">has been established. In other words, the
political construction of the subject proceeds with certain legitimating
and exclusionary aims, and these political operations are effectively
concealed and naturalized by a political analysis that takes juridical
structures as their foundation. </span><span class="c-2">Juridical power inevitably “produces”
what it claims merely to represent; hence, politics must be concerned
with this dual function of power: the juridical and the productive.</span><span class="c-1"> In
</span><span class="c-2">effect, the law produces and then conceals the notion of “a subject
before the law”2 in order to invoke that discursive formation as a naturalized foundational premise </span><span class="c-1">that subsequently legitimates that law’s
own regulatory hegemony.</span><span class="c-0"> It is not </span><span class="c-5">enough to </span><span class="c-6">inquire into how women
might become more fully represented in language and politics.
Feminist critique ought also </span><span class="c-5">to </span><span class="c-11">understand how the category of
“</span><span class="c-13">women,” the subject of feminism, is produced and restrained by the
very structures of power through which emancipation </span><span class="c-11">is sought.</span><span class="c-1">
</span><span class="c-2">Indeed, the </span><span class="c-6">question of women as the subject of feminism raises
the possibility that there may not be a subject who stands “before” the
law, awaiting representation </span><span class="c-3">in or by the law. Perhaps the subject,</span><span class="c-1"> as
well as the invocation of a temporal “before,” is constituted by the law
as the fictive foundation of its own claim to legitimacy. The </span><span class="c-2">prevailing
assumption of the ontological integrity of the subject before the law
might be understood as the contemporary trace of the state of nature
hypothesis, that foundationalist fable constitutive of the juridical structures of classical liberalism. The performative invocation of a nonhistorical “before” </span><span class="c-3">becomes the foundational premise that guarantees a
presocial ontology of persons who freely consent to be governed and,
thereby, constitute the legitimacy of the social contract.</span><span class="c-0">
~
</span><span class="c-1">Apart from the foundationalist fictions that support the notion of
the subject, however, there is the political problem that feminism
encounters in the assumption that the term women denotes a common
identity.</span><span class="c-0"> Rather than a stable signifier that </span><span class="c-2">commands the assent of those
whom it purports to describe and represent, women, even in the plural,
has become a troublesome term,</span><span class="c-0"> a site of contest, a cause for anxiety.As
Denise Riley’s title suggests, Am I That Name? is a question produced by
the very possibility of the name’s multiple significations.3 If one “is” a
</span><span class="c-8">woman, that is surely not all one is; the term fails to be exhaustive, not
because </span><span class="c-5">a pregendered “person” transcends the specific paraphernalia of
its gender, but </span><span class="c-11">because </span><span class="c-16">gender is not </span><span class="c-17">always constituted coherently or
consistently in different historical contexts,</span><span class="c-15"> and </span><span class="c-17">because </span><span class="c-18">gender </span><span class="c-20">intersects with racial, class, ethnic, sexual, and regional modalities of discursively constituted </span><span class="c-16">identities.</span><span class="c-6"> As a result, it </span><span class="c-8">becomes impossible </span><span class="c-6">to
separate out “gender” from the political and cultural intersections in
which it is invariably produced </span><span class="c-5">and maintained.</span><span class="c-0">
The political assumption that there must be a universal basis for
feminism, one which must be found in an identity assumed to exist
cross-culturally, often accompanies the notion that the </span><span class="c-1">oppression of
women has some singular form discernible in the universal or hegemonic structure of patriarchy or masculine domination.</span><span class="c-0"> The notion of
a universal patriarchy has been widely criticized in recent years for its
</span><span class="c-1">failure to account for the workings of gender oppression in the concrete cultural contexts in which it exists.</span><span class="c-0">Where those various contexts
have been consulted within such theories, it has been to find “examples” or “illustrations” of a universal principle that is assumed from the
start.That </span><span class="c-3">form of feminist theorizing has come under criticism for its
efforts to colonize and appropriate non-Western cultures to support
highly Western notions of oppression, but beca<a name="b-6"></a>use they tend as well to
construct a “Third World” or even an “Orient” in which gender oppression is subtly explained as symptomatic of an essential, non-Western
barbarism.</span><span class="c-0"> The urgency of feminism to establish a universal status for
patriarchy in order to strengthen the appearance of feminism’s own
~
claims to be representative has occasionally motivated the shortcut to a
categorial or </span><span class="c-1">fictive universality of the structure of domination, held to
produce women’s common subjugated </span><span class="c-0">experience.
</span><span class="c-1">Although the claim of universal patriarchy no longer enjoys the
kind of credibility it once did, the notion of a generally shared conception of “women,” the corollary to that framework, has been much more
difficult to displace.</span><span class="c-0"> Certainly, there have been plenty of debates: Is
there some commonality among “women” that preexists their oppression, or do “women” have a bond by virtue of their oppression alone? Is
there a specificity to women’s cultures that is independent of their subordination by hegemonic, masculinist cultures? Are the specificity and
integrity of women’s cultural or linguistic practices always specified
against and, hence, within the terms of some more dominant cultural
formation? If there is a region of the “specifically feminine,” one that is
both differentiated from the masculine as such and recognizable in its
difference by an unmarked and, hence, presumed universality of
“women”? The masculine/feminine binary constitutes not only the
exclusive framework in which that specificity can be recognized, but
in every other way the “specificity” of the feminine is once again fully
decontextualized and separated off analytically and politically from
the constitution of class, race, ethnicity, and other axes of power relations that both constitute “identity” and make the singular notion of
identity a misnomer.4
My suggestion is that the presumed universality and unity of the
subject of feminism is effectively undermined by the constraints of the
representational discourse in which it functions. Indeed, the premature
insistence on a </span><span class="c-1">stable subject of feminism, understood as a seamless category of women, inevitably generates multiple refusals to accept the
category.</span><span class="c-0">These domains of exclusion reveal the coercive and regulatory
consequences of that construction, even when the construction has
been elaborated for emancipatory purposes. Indeed, the </span><span class="c-1">fragmentation
within feminism and the paradoxical opposition to feminism from
“women” whom feminism claims </span><span class="c-0">to represent suggest the necessary
~
limits of identity politics. The suggestion that feminism can seek wider
representation for a subject that it itself </span><span class="c-1">constructs has the ironic consequence that </span><span class="c-2">feminist goals </span><span class="c-3">risk failure by refusing to take account of the
constitutive powers of their own representational claims.</span><span class="c-1">This </span><span class="c-0">problem
is not ameliorated through an appeal to the category of women for
merely “strategic” purposes, for </span><span class="c-2">strategies always have meanings that
exceed the purposes for which they are intended.</span><span class="c-0"> In this case, exclusion
itself might qualify as such an unintended yet consequential meaning. By
</span><span class="c-2">conforming to a requirement of representational politics that feminism
articulate a stable subject, feminism thus opens itself to charges of gross
misrepresentation.
Obviously, the </span><span class="c-3">political task is not to refuse representational politics—</span><span class="c-1">as if we could. The </span><span class="c-2">juridical structures of language and politics
constitute the contemporary field of power;</span><span class="c-0"> hence, </span><span class="c-1">there is no position
outside this field, but only a critical genealogy of its own legitimating
practices.</span><span class="c-0">As such, the critical point of departure is the historical present,
as Marx put it. And the </span><span class="c-2">task is to </span><span class="c-4">formulate within this constituted
frame a </span><span class="c-5">critique of the </span><span class="c-6">categories of identity that contemporary juridical structures engender, naturalize, and immobilize.</span><span class="c-0">
Perhaps there is an opportunity at this juncture of cultural politics,
a period that some would call “postfeminist,” to reflect from within a
feminist perspective on the injunction to construct a subject of feminism. Within feminist political practice, a radical rethinking of the
ontological constructions of identity appears to be necessary in order
to formulate a representational politics that might revive feminism on
other grounds. On the other hand, it </span><span class="c-2">may be time to entertain a radical
critique that seeks to free feminist theory from the necessity of having
to construct a single or abiding ground which is invariably contested
by those identity positions or anti-identity positions that it invariably
excludes. Do the exclusionary practices that ground feminist theory in
a notion of “women” as subject paradoxically undercut feminist goals
to extend its claims </span><span class="c-0">to “representation”?5
Perhaps the problem is even more serious. Is the </span><span class="c-1">construction of
~
the category of women as a coherent and stable subject an unwitting
regulation and reification of gender relations?</span><span class="c-0"> And is not such a reification precisely contrary to feminist aims? To what </span><span class="c-1">extent does the category of women achieve stability and coherence only in the context of
the heterosexual matrix?6 If a </span><span class="c-3">stable notion of gender no longer proves
to be the </span><span class="c-4">foundational premise of feminist politics,</span><span class="c-2"> </span><span class="c-3">perhaps a </span><span class="c-4">new sort
of feminist politics is now desirable to contest the very reifications of
gender and identity, one that </span><span class="c-5">will take the variable </span><span class="c-4">construction of
identity as both a methodological and normative prerequisite, if not a
political goal.</span><span class="c-0">
To </span><span class="c-1">trace the political operations that produce and conceal what
qualifies as the juridical subject of feminism is precisely the task of a
feminist genealogy of the category of women.</span><span class="c-0"> In the course of this effort
to question “women” as the subject of feminism, the unproblematic
invocation of that category may prove to preclude the possibility of feminism as a representational politics. What </span><span class="c-1">sense does it make to extend
representation to subjects who are constructed through the exclusion
of those who fail to conform to unspoken normative requirements of
the </span><span class="c-2">subject? What relations </span><span class="c-1">of domination and exclusion are inadvertently sustained when representation </span><span class="c-2">becomes the sole focus of politics?</span><span class="c-1">
The </span><span class="c-2">identity of the feminist subject ought not to be the foundation of
feminist politics, if the formation of the subject takes place within a
field of power regularly buried through the assertion of that foundation.</span><span class="c-1">
Perhaps, paradoxically, “representation”</span><span class="c-0"> will be shown to make sense
for feminism only when the subject of “women” is nowhere presumed.
ii. The Compulsory Order of Sex/Gender/Desire
Although the unproblematic unity of “women” is often invoked to construct a solidarity of identity, a split is introduced in the feminist subject
by the distinction between sex and gender. </span><span class="c-1">Originally intended to dispute the biology-is-destiny formulation, the distinction between sex
and gender serves the argument that </span><span class="c-3">whatever biological intractability
sex appears to have, </span><span class="c-4">gender is culturally constructed:</span><span class="c-2"> hence, </span><span class="c-3">gender is
~
neither the causal result of sex nor as seemingly fixed </span><span class="c-2">as sex.</span><span class="c-0">The unity
of the subject is thus already potentially contested by the distinction
that permits of gender as a multiple interpretation of sex. 7
If </span><span class="c-7">gender is the cultural meanings that the sexed body assumes,
then a gender cannot be said </span><span class="c-5">to follow from a sex in any one way.</span><span class="c-3">Taken
to its logical limit, the </span><span class="c-7">sex/gender distinction </span><span class="c-9">suggests a radical discontinuity between sexed bodies and culturally constructed genders.</span><span class="c-2">
</span><span class="c-5">Assuming for the moment the stability of binary sex, it does not follow
that the construction of “men” will accrue exclusively to the bodies </span><span class="c-3">of
males or that “women” will interpret only female bodies.</span><span class="c-2"> Further, even
if the sexes appear to be unproblematically binary in their morphology
and constitution (which will become a question), there is no reason to
assume that genders ought also to remain as two.</span><span class="c-0">8 The </span><span class="c-1">presumption of
a </span><span class="c-2">binary gender system </span><span class="c-3">implicitly retains the </span><span class="c-6">belief in a mimetic relation of gender to sex whereby gender </span><span class="c-3">mirrors sex or is otherwise
restricted </span><span class="c-1">by it. When the </span><span class="c-8">constructed </span><span class="c-9">status of gender is theorized as
radically independent of sex, </span><span class="c-11">gender itself becomes a </span><span class="c-13">free-floating artifice, with the </span><span class="c-15">consequence that </span><span class="c-16">man and masculine might just as easily
signify a female body as a male one, and woman and feminine </span><span class="c-15">a male
body </span><span class="c-14">as easily as a female </span><span class="c-3">one.
This </span><span class="c-0">radical splitting of the gendered subject poses yet another set
of problems. Can we refer to a “given” sex or a “given” gender without
first inquiring into how sex and/or gender is given, through what
means? And what is “</span><span class="c-4">sex” anyway? Is it </span><span class="c-5">natural, anatomical, chromosomal, or hormonal, and how is a feminist critic to assess the scientific
discourses which purport to establish such “facts” for us?</span><span class="c-2">9 Does sex
have a history?10 Does each sex have a different history, or histories? Is
there a history of how the duality of sex was established, a </span><span class="c-4">genealogy
that might expose the binary options as a variable construction?</span><span class="c-1"> Are
the ostensibly natural facts of sex discursively produced by various scientific discourses in the service of other political and social interests?
If the </span><span class="c-12">immutable character of sex is contested, </span><span class="c-18">perhaps </span><span class="c-21">this construct
called “sex” is as culturally constructed as gender; indeed,</span><span class="c-20"> </span><span class="c-21">perhaps it
~
was </span><span class="c-22">always already </span><span class="c-23">gender, with the consequence </span><span class="c-21">that the distinction
between sex and gender turns out to be no distinction at all.</span><span class="c-3">11
It would make no sense, then, to </span><span class="c-4">define gender as the cultural
interpretation </span><span class="c-2">of sex, if sex itself is a gendered category. </span><span class="c-12">Gender </span><span class="c-13">ought
</span><span class="c-12">not to be </span><span class="c-14">conceived merely as the cultural inscription of meaning on a
pregiven sex (a juridical conception); gender must also </span><span class="c-15">designate the
very </span><span class="c-18">apparatus of production whereby the sexes </span><span class="c-16">themselves are </span><span class="c-18">established.</span><span class="c-8"> As a result,</span><span class="c-7"> </span><span class="c-13">gender is not to culture as sex is to nature; </span><span class="c-14">gender is
also the </span><span class="c-16">discursive/cultural </span><span class="c-17">means by which “sexed nature” or “a natural </span><span class="c-16">sex” is produced </span><span class="c-13">and </span><span class="c-14">established as “</span><span class="c-16">prediscursive,” </span><span class="c-17">prior </span><span class="c-16">to culture,</span><span class="c-15">
a politically neutral surface </span><span class="c-14">on which culture </span><span class="c-13">acts.</span><span class="c-0"> This construction of
“sex” as the radically unconstructed will concern us again in the discussion of Lévi-Strauss and structuralism in chapter 2. At this juncture it
is already clear that one way the internal stability and binary frame for
sex is effectively secured is by casting the duality of sex in a prediscursive domain. This </span><span class="c-2">production of sex as the prediscursive ought to be
understood as the effect of the apparatus of cultural construction designated by gender.</span><span class="c-0"> How, then, does gender need to be reformulated to
encompass the power relations that produce the effect of a prediscursive sex and so conceal that very operation of discursive production?
iii. Gender: The Circular Ruins of
Contemporary Debate
Is there “a” gender which persons are said to have, or is it an essential
attribute that a person is said to be, as implied in the question “What
gender are you?” When feminist t<a name="b-7"></a>heorists claim that gender is the cultural interpretation of sex or that gender is culturally constructed, what
is the manner or mechanism of this construction? If gender is constructed, could it be constructed differently, or does its constructedness
imply some form of social determinism, foreclosing the possibility of
agency and transformation? Does “construction” suggest that certain
laws generate gender differences along universal axes of sexual difference? How and where does the construction of gender take place? What
~
sense can we make of a construction that cannot assume a human constructor prior to that </span><span class="c-1">construction? On </span><span class="c-2">some accounts, the notion that
gender is constructed suggests a certain determinism of gender meanings inscribed on anatomically differentiated bodies, where those bodies are understood as passive recipients of an inexorable </span><span class="c-1">cultural law.</span><span class="c-0">
When the relevant “culture” that “</span><span class="c-1">constructs” gender is understood in
terms of such a law or set of laws, then it seems that gender is as determined and fixed as it was under the biology-is-destiny formulation. In
such a case, not biology, but culture, becomes destiny.</span><span class="c-0">
On the other hand, Simone de Beauvoir suggests in The Second Sex
that “one is not born a woman, but, rather, becomes one.”12 For
Beauvoir, gender is “constructed,” but implied in her formulation is an
agent, a cogito, who somehow takes on or appropriates that gender and
could, in principle, take on some other gender. Is gender as variable
and volitional as Beauvoir’s account seems to suggest? Can “construction” in such a case be reduced to a form of choice? Beauvoir is clear
that one “becomes” a woman, but always under a cultural compulsion
to become one. And clearly, the compulsion does not come from “sex.”
There is nothing in her account that guarantees that the “one” who
becomes a woman is necessarily female. If “the body is a situation,”13 as
she </span><span class="c-2">claims, </span><span class="c-3">there is no recourse to a body that has not always already
been interpreted by cultural </span><span class="c-1">meanings;</span><span class="c-0"> hence, sex could not qualify as
a prediscursive anatomical facticity. Indeed, </span><span class="c-3">sex, by definition, will be
shown to have been gender all </span><span class="c-2">along.</span><span class="c-0">14
The controversy over the meaning of construction appears to
founder on the conventional philosophical polarity between free will
and determinism. As a consequence, one might reasonably suspect that
some common linguistic restriction on thought both forms and limits
the terms of the debate. Within those terms, “the body” appears as a
passive medium on which cultural meanings are inscribed or as the
instrument through which an appropriative and interpretive will
~
ings are only externally related. But “the </span><span class="c-1">body” is itself a construction,
as are the myriad “bodies” that constitute the domain of gendered subjects.</span><span class="c-0"> Bodies cannot be said to have a signifiable existence prior to the
mark of their gender; the question then emerges:To what extent does
the body come into being in and through the mark(s) of gender? How do
we </span><span class="c-2">reconceive the body no longer as a passive medium or instrument
awaiting the enlivening capacity of a distinctly immaterial will?</span><span class="c-0">15
Whether gender or sex is fixed or free is a function of a discourse
which, it will be suggested, seeks to set certain limits to analysis or to
safeguard certain tenets of humanism as presuppositional to any analysis of gender. The locus of intractability, whether in “sex” or “gender”
or in the very meaning of “construction,” provides a clue to what cultural possibilities can and cannot become mobilized through any further analysis.The limits of the </span><span class="c-1">discursive analysis of gender presuppose
and preempt the possibilities of imaginable and realizable gender configurations within culture.</span><span class="c-0"> This is not to say that any and all gendered
possibilities are open, but that the </span><span class="c-1">boundaries of analysis suggest the
limits of a discursively conditioned experience.These limits are always
set within the terms of a hegemonic cultural discourse predicated on
binary structures that appear as the language of universal rationality.
Constraint is thus built into what that language constitutes as the imaginable domain of gender.</span><span class="c-0">
Although social scientists refer to gender as a “factor” or a “dimension”
of an analysis, it is also applied to embodied persons as “a mark” of biological, linguistic, and/or cultural difference. In these latter cases,
gender can be understood as a signification that an (already) sexually
differentiated body assumes, but even then that signification exists
only in relation to another, opposing signification. Some feminist theorists claim that gender is “a relation,” indeed, a set of relations, and not
an individual attribute. Others, following Beauvoir, would argue that
only the </span><span class="c-1">feminine gender is marked, that the universal person and the
masculine gender are conflated, thereby defining women in terms of
~
their sex and extolling men as the bearers of a body-transcendent universal personhood.</span><span class="c-0">
In a move that complicates the discussion further, Luce Irigaray
argues that women constitute a paradox, if not a contradiction, within
the discourse of identity itself.Women are the “sex” which is not “one.”
</span><span class="c-1">Within a language pervasively masculinist, a phallogocentric language,
women constitute the unrepresentable. In other words, </span><span class="c-2">women represent the sex that cannot be thought, a linguistic absence and opacity.</span><span class="c-0">
</span><span class="c-1">Within a language that rests on univocal signification, the female sex
constitutes the unconstrainable </span><span class="c-0">and undesignatable. In this sense,
women are the sex which is not “one,” but multiple.16 In opposition to
Beauvoir, for whom women are designated as the Other, Irigaray
argues that both the subject and the Other are masculine mainstays of a
closed phallogocentric signifying economy that achieves its totalizing
goal through the exclusion of the feminine altogether. For Beauvoir,
women are the negative of men, the lack against which masculine identity differentiates itself; for Irigaray, that particular dialectic constitutes a system that excludes an entirely different economy of
signification. Women are not only represented falsely within the
Sartrian frame of signifying-subject and signified-Other, but the falsity
of the signification points out the entire structure of representation as
inadequate. The sex which is not one, then, provides a point of departure for a criticism of hegemonic Western representation and of the
metaphysics of substance that structures the very notion of the subject.
What is the metaphysics of substance, and how does it inform
thinking about the categories of sex? In the first instance, </span><span class="c-1">humanist
conceptions of the subject tend to assume a substantive person who is
the bearer of various essential and nonessential attributes. A humanist
feminist position might understand gender as an attribute of a person
who is characterized essentially as a pregendered substance or “core,”
called the person, denoting a universal capacity for reason, moral
deliberation, or language.</span><span class="c-0"> The universal conception of the person,
~
der by those historical and anthropological positions that understand
</span><span class="c-2">gender as a </span><span class="c-4">relation among socially constituted subjects in specifiable
contexts.</span><span class="c-0">This relational or contextual point of view suggests that what
the person “is,” and, indeed, what gender “is,” is </span><span class="c-2">always relative to the
constructed relations in which it is determined.17 As a shifting and
contextual </span><span class="c-3">phenomenon, gender </span><span class="c-4">does not denote a </span><span class="c-5">substantive being,
but a </span><span class="c-6">relative point of convergence among culturally and historically
specific </span><span class="c-5">sets of relations.</span><span class="c-0">
Irigaray would maintain, however, that the feminine “sex” is a point
of linguistic absence, the impossibility of a grammatically denoted substance, and, hence, the point of view that exposes that substance as an
abiding and foundational illusion of a masculinist discourse. This
absence is not marked as such within the masculine signifying economy—a contention that reverses Beauvoir’s argument (and Wittig’s)
that the female sex is marked, while the male sex is not. For Irigaray,
the female sex is not a “lack” or an “Other” that immanently and negatively defines the subject in its masculinity. On the </span><span class="c-2">contrary, the </span><span class="c-3">female
sex eludes the very requirements of representation, for she is neither
“Other”</span><span class="c-2"> nor the “lack,” those categories remaining relative to the
Sartrian subject, immanent to that phallogocentric scheme.</span><span class="c-0"> Hence, for
Irigaray, the feminine could never be the mark of a subject, as Beauvoir
would suggest. Further, the feminine could not be theorized in terms
of a determinate relation between the masculine and the feminine within any given discourse, for discourse is not a relevant notion here. Even
in their variety, discourses constitute so many modalities of phallogocentric language.The female sex is thus also the subject that is not one.
The relation between masculine and feminine cannot be represented in
a signifying economy in which the masculine constitutes the closed circle of signifier and signified. Paradoxically enough, Beauvoir prefigured this impossibility in The Second Sex when she argued that men
could not settle the question of women because they would then be
acting as both judge and party to the case.18
The distinctions among the above positions are far from discrete;
~
each of them can be understood to problematize the locality and
meaning of both the “subject” and “gender” within the context of
socially instituted gender asymmetry. The interpretive possibilities of
gender are in no sense exhausted by the alternatives suggested above.
The problematic circularity of a feminist inquiry into gender is underscored by the presence of positions which, on the one hand, presume
that gender is a secondary characteristic of persons and those which,
on the other hand, argue that the very notion of the person, positioned
within language as a “subject,” is a masculinist construction and prerogative which effectively excludes the structural and semantic possibility
of a feminine gender. The consequence of such sharp disagreements
about the meaning of gender (indeed, whether gender is the term to be
argued about at all, or whether the discursive construction of sex is,
indeed, more fundamental, or perhaps women or woman and/or men and
man) </span><span class="c-1">establishes the need for a radical rethinking of the categories of
identity within the context of relations of radical gender asymmetry.</span><span class="c-0">
For </span><span class="c-1">Beauvoir, the “subject” within the existential analytic of misogyny is always already masculine, conflated with the universal, differentiating itself from a feminine “Other” outside the universalizing norms
of personhood, hopelessly “particular,” embodied, condemned to
immanence. </span><span class="c-2">Although Beauvoir is often understood to be calling for
the right of women, in effect, to become existential subjects and,
hence, for inclusion within the terms of an abstract universality, her
position also implies a fundamental criti<a name="b-8"></a>que of the very disembodiment of the abstract masculine epistemological subject.19 That subject
is abstract to the extent that it disavows its socially marked embodiment and, further, projects that disavowed and disparaged embodiment on to the feminine sphere,</span><span class="c-1"> effectively renaming the body as
female.This association of the body with the female works along magical relations of reciprocity whereby the female sex becomes restricted
to its body, and the male body, fully disavowed, becomes, paradoxically, the incorporeal instrument of an ostensibly radical freedom.
Beauvoir’s analysis implicitly poses the question: Through what act of
~
negation and disavowal does the masculine pose as a disembodied universality and the feminine get constructed as a disavowed corporeality?</span><span class="c-0">
The dialectic of master-slave, here fully reformulated within the nonreciprocal terms of gender asymmetry, prefigures what Irigaray will
later describe as the masculine signifying economy that includes both
the existential subject and its Other.
Beauvoir proposes that the female body ought to be the situation
and instrumentality of women’s freedom, not a defining and limiting
essence.20 The theory of embodiment informing Beauvoir’s analysis is
clearly limited by the uncritical reproduction of the Cartesian distinction between freedom and the body. Despite my own previous efforts
to argue the contrary, it appears that Beauvoir maintains the mind/
body dualism, even as she proposes a synthesis of those terms.21 The
preservation of that very distinction can be read as symptomatic of the
very phallogocentrism that Beauvoir underestimates. In the </span><span class="c-1">philosophical tradition that </span><span class="c-3">begins with Plato and continues through Descartes,
Husserl, and Sartre, the ontological distinction between soul (consciousness, mind) and body </span><span class="c-1">invariably supports relations of political
and psychic </span><span class="c-0">subordination and hierarchy.The mind not only subjugates
the body, but occasionally entertains the fantasy of fleeing its embodiment altogether. The </span><span class="c-3">cultural associations of mind with masculinity
and body with </span><span class="c-4">femininity are well documented within the field of philosophy and feminism.22 As a result, any uncritical </span><span class="c-5">reproduction of the
mind/body distinction ought to be rethought for the implicit gender
hierarchy that the distinction has conventionally </span><span class="c-3">produced, maintained, and rationalized.</span><span class="c-0">
The discursive construction of “the body” and its separation from
“freedom” in Beauvoir fails to mark along the axis of gender the very
mind-body distinction that is supposed to illuminate the persistence of
gender asymmetry. Officially, Beauvoir contends that the </span><span class="c-1">female body
is marked within masculinist discourse, whereby the masculine body,
in its conflation with the universal, remains unmarked.</span><span class="c-0"> Irigaray clearly suggests that both marker and marked are maintained within a
~
masculinist mode of signification in which the female body is “marked
off,” as it were, from the domain of the signifiable. In post-Hegelian
terms, she is “cancelled,” but not preserved. On Irigaray’s reading,
Beauvoir’s claim that woman “is sex” is reversed to mean that she is not
the sex she is designated to be, but, rather, the </span><span class="c-2">masculine sex encore (and
en corps) parading in the mode of otherness.</span><span class="c-0"> For Irigaray, that phallogocentric mode of signifying the female sex perpetually reproduces phantasms of its own self-amplifying desire. Instead of a self-limiting
linguistic gesture that grants alterity or difference to women, phallogocentrism offers a name to eclipse the feminine and take its place.
iv. Theorizing the Binary, the Unitary, and Beyond
Beauvoir and Irigaray clearly differ over the fundamental structures by
which gender asymmetry is reproduced; Beauvoir turns to the failed
reciprocity of an asymmetrical dialectic, while Irigaray suggests that
the dialectic itself is the monologic elaboration of a masculinist signifying economy. Although Irigaray clearly broadens the scope of feminist
critique by exposing the epistemological, ontological, and logical
structures of a masculinist signifying economy, the power of her analysis is undercut precisely by its globalizing reach. Is it possible to identify a monolithic as well as a monologic masculinist economy that
traverses the array of cultural and historical contexts in which sexual
difference takes place? Is the failure to acknowledge the specific cultural operations of gender oppression itself a kind of epistemological
imperialism, one which is not ameliorated by the simple elaboration of
cultural differences as “examples” of the selfsame phallogocentrism?
The </span><span class="c-4">effort to include “Other” </span><span class="c-6">cultures as variegated amplifications of a
global phallogocentrism constitutes an appropriative act that risks a
repetition of the self-aggrandizing gesture of phallogocentrism, colonizing under the sign of the same those differences that might otherwise call that totalizing concept into question.</span><span class="c-0">23
</span><span class="c-2">Feminist critique ought to explore the totalizing claims of a masculinist signifying economy, but also remain self-critical with respect to
~
the totalizing gestures of feminism. The effort to identify the enemy as
singular in form is a reverse-discourse that uncritically </span><span class="c-3">mimics the
strategy of the oppressor instead of offering a different set of terms.</span><span class="c-1">
That the tactic can operate in feminist and antifeminist contexts alike
suggests that the colonizing gesture is not primarily or irreducibly masculinist.</span><span class="c-0"> It can operate to effect other relations of racial, class, and heterosexist subordination, to name but a few. And clearly, listing the
varieties of oppression, as I began to do, assumes their discrete, sequential coexistence along a horizontal axis that does not describe their convergences within the social field. A vertical model is similarly
insufficient; oppressions cannot be summarily ranked, causally related,
distributed among planes of “originality” and “derivativeness.”24 Indeed,
the field of power structured in part by the imperializing gesture of
dialectical appropriation exceeds and encompasses the axis of sexual
difference, offering a mapping of intersecting differentials which cannot
be summarily hierarchized either within the terms of phallogocentrism
or any other candidate for the position of “primary condition of oppression.” Rather than an exclusive tactic of masculinist signifying economies, dialectical appropriation and suppression of the Other is one
tactic among many, deployed centrally but not exclusively in the service
of expanding and rationalizing the masculinist domain.
The contemporary feminist debates over essentialism raise the
question of the universality of female identity and masculinist oppression in other ways. Universalistic claims are based on a common or
shared epistemological standpoint, understood as the articulated consciousness or shared structures of oppression or in the ostensibly transcultural structures of femininity, maternity, sexuality, and/or écriture
feminine. The opening discussion in this chapter argued that this globalizing gesture has spawned a number of criticisms from women who
claim that the category of “women” is normative and exclusionary and
is </span><span class="c-1">invoked with the unmarked dimensions of class and racial privilege
intact.</span><span class="c-0"> In other words, the insistence upon the coherence and unity of
the category of women has effectively </span><span class="c-1">refused the multiplicity of
~
cultural, social, and political intersections in which the concrete array
of “women” are constructed.</span><span class="c-0">
Some efforts have been made to formulate coalitional politics
which do not assume in advance what the content of “women” will be.
They propose instead a set of dialogic encounters by which variously
positioned women articulate separate identities within the framework
of an emergent coalition. Clearly, the value of coalitional politics is not
to be underestimated, but the very form of coalition, of an emerging
and unpredictable assemblage of positions, cannot be figured in
advance. </span><span class="c-1">Despite the clearly democratizing impulse that motivates
coalition building, the coalitional theorist can inadvertently reinsert
herself as sovereign of the process by trying to assert an ideal form for
coalitional structures in advance, one that will effectively guarantee
unity as the outcome.</span><span class="c-0"> Related efforts to determine what is and is not
the true shape of a dialogue, what constitutes a subject-position, and,
most importantly, when “unity” has been reached, can impede the selfshaping and self-limiting dynamics of coalition.
The insistence in advance on coalitional “unity” as a goal assumes
that </span><span class="c-1">solidarity, whatever its price, is a prerequisite for political action.
But what sort of politics demands that kind of advance purchase on
unity?</span><span class="c-0"> </span><span class="c-1">Perhaps a coalition needs to acknowledge its contradictions and
take action with those contradictions intact.</span><span class="c-0"> Perhaps also part of what
dialogic understanding entails is the acceptance of divergence, breakage, splinter, and fragmentation as part of the often tortuous process of
democratization. The very notion of “</span><span class="c-1">dialogue” is </span><span class="c-3">culturally specific
and historically bound, and while one speaker may feel secure that a
conversation is happening, another may be sure it is not. The power
relations that condition and limit dialogic possibilities need first to be
interrogated.</span><span class="c-1"> Otherwise, the model of dialogue risks </span><span class="c-2">relapsing into a
liberal model that assumes that speaking agents occupy equal positions
of power and speak with the same presuppositions about what constitutes “agreement”</span><span class="c-1"> and “unity” and, indeed, that those are the goals </span><span class="c-0">to
~
gory of “</span><span class="c-3">women” that simply needs to be filled in with various components of race, class, age, ethnicity, and sexuality in order to become
complete. The assumption of its </span><span class="c-5">essential incompleteness </span><span class="c-6">permits that
category to serve as a permanently available site of contested meanings.</span><span class="c-4">The definitional </span><span class="c-1">incompleteness of the category might then serve
as a normative ideal relieved of coercive force.</span><span class="c-0">
Is “unity” necessary for effective political action? Is the premature
insistence on the goal of unity precisely the cause of an ever more bitter fragmentation among the ranks? </span><span class="c-1">Certain forms of acknowledged
fragmentation might facilitate coalitional action precisely because the
“unity” of the category of women is neither presupposed </span><span class="c-0">nor desired.
</span><span class="c-1">Does “unity” </span><span class="c-2">set up an exclusionary norm of solidarity at the level of
identity that rules out the possibility of a set of actions which disrupt
the very borders of identity concepts, or which seek to accomplish
precisely that disruption as an explicit political aim?</span><span class="c-1"> Without the presupposition or goal of “unity,” which is, in either case, always instituted
at a conceptual level, </span><span class="c-2">provisional unities might emerge in the context
of concrete actions that have purposes other than the articulation of
identity.</span><span class="c-1"> Without the compulsory expectation that feminist actions
must be instituted from some stable, unifi<a name="b-9"></a>ed, and agreed-upon identity, those actions might well get a quicker start and seem more congenial to a number of “women”</span><span class="c-0"> for whom the meaning of the category is
permanently moot.
This antifoundationalist approach to coalitional politics assumes
neither that “identity” is a premise nor that the shape or meaning of a
coalitional assemblage can be known prior to its achievement. Because
the articulation of an identity within available cultural terms instates a
definition that forecloses in advance the emergence of new identity
concepts in and through politically engaged actions, the foundationalist
tactic cannot take the transformation or expansion of existing identity
concepts as a normative goal. Moreover, when agreed-upon identities
or agreed-upon dialogic structures, through which already established identities are communicated, no longer constitute the theme or
~
subject of politics, then identities can come into being and dissolve
depending on the concrete practices that constitute them. Certain
political practices institute identities on a contingent basis in order to
accomplish whatever aims are in view. Coalitional politics requires neither an expanded category of “women” nor an internally multiplicitous
self that offers its complexity at once.
</span><span class="c-9">Gender is a </span><span class="c-10">complexity whose totality is permanently deferred,
never fully what it is at any given juncture in time.</span><span class="c-6"> An </span><span class="c-9">open coalition,
then, will affirm </span><span class="c-10">identities that are alternately instituted and relinquished according to the purposes </span><span class="c-8">at hand;</span><span class="c-7"> it will be an open assemblage that permits of multiple convergences and divergences without
obedience to a normative telos of definitional </span><span class="c-5">closure.</span><span class="c-0">
v. Identity, Sex, and the Metaphysics of Substance
What can be </span><span class="c-1">meant by “identity,” then, and what </span><span class="c-2">grounds the presumption that identities are self-identical, persisting through time as the
same, unified and internally coherent?</span><span class="c-0"> More importantly, how do
these assumptions inform the discourses on “gender identity”? It </span><span class="c-2">would
be wrong to think that the discussion of “identity” </span><span class="c-3">ought to proceed
prior to a discussion of gender identity for the simple reason that “</span><span class="c-8">persons” only become intelligible through becoming gendered in conformity </span><span class="c-6">with recognizable standards of gender </span><span class="c-5">intelligibility.</span><span class="c-0"> Sociological
discussions have conventionally sought to understand the notion of the
person in terms of an agency that claims ontological priority to the
various roles and functions through which it assumes social visibility
and meaning. Within philosophical discourse itself, the notion of “the
person” has received analytic elaboration on the assumption that whatever social context the person is “in” remains somehow externally
related to the definitional structure of personhood, be that consciousness, the capacity for language, or moral deliberation. Although that
literature is not examined here, one premise of such inquiries is the
focus of critical exploration and inversion. Whereas the </span><span class="c-1">question of
what constitutes “personal identity” within philosophical accounts
</span><span class="c-0">~
</span><span class="c-3">almost always centers on the question of what internal feature of the
person establishes the continuity or self-identity of the person through
time, the question here will be:To what </span><span class="c-6">extent do </span><span class="c-7">regulatory practices of
gender formation and division constitute identity,</span><span class="c-6"> the internal coherence of the subject, indeed, the self-identical status of the person?</span><span class="c-5"> To
what extent is “identity” a normative ideal rather than a descriptive
feature of experience?</span><span class="c-1"> And how do the regulatory practices that govern gender also govern culturally intelligible notions of identity?</span><span class="c-0"> In
</span><span class="c-1">other words, the “</span><span class="c-6">coherence” and “continuity” of “the </span><span class="c-9">person” are not
logical or analytic features of personhood, but, rather, socially instituted </span><span class="c-8">and maintained norms </span><span class="c-5">of intelligibility.</span><span class="c-0"> </span><span class="c-1">Inasmuch as “</span><span class="c-2">identity” is
assured through the stabilizing concepts of sex, gender, and sexuality,</span><span class="c-1">
the very notion of “the person” is </span><span class="c-2">called into question by the cultural
emergence of </span><span class="c-3">those “incoherent” or “</span><span class="c-4">discontinuous” gendered beings
who appear to be persons but who fail to conform to the gendered
norms of cultural intelligibility </span><span class="c-2">by which persons are defined.</span><span class="c-0">
“</span><span class="c-4">Intelligible” </span><span class="c-6">genders </span><span class="c-7">are those which in </span><span class="c-8">some sense </span><span class="c-9">institute and
</span><span class="c-10">maintain relations </span><span class="c-9">of coherence and continuity among sex, gender,
sexual practice,</span><span class="c-8"> and desire.</span><span class="c-1"> In other words, the </span><span class="c-4">spectres of discontinuity and incoherence, </span><span class="c-5">themselves thinkable only in relation to existing
norms of continuity and coherence,</span><span class="c-4"> </span><span class="c-5">are constantly prohibited and produced by the very laws that seek to establish causal or expressive lines
</span><span class="c-3">of connection among biological sex, culturally constituted genders,
and the “expression” or “effect” of both in the manifestation of sexual

The notion that </span><span class="c-1">there might be a “truth” of sex, as Foucault ironically terms it, is produced precisely through the regulatory practices that
generate coherent identities through the matrix of coherent gender
norms. The </span><span class="c-8">heterosexualization of desire </span><span class="c-9">requires and institutes the
production of discrete and asymmetrical oppositions between
“feminine”</span><span class="c-8"> and “masculine,” where these are understood as expressive
</span><span class="c-7">attributes </span><span class="c-6">of “male”</span><span class="c-4"> and “female.</span><span class="c-3">” The </span><span class="c-10">cultural matrix through which
gender identity has become intelligible requires that certain kinds of
~
“identities” cannot “exist”—that is, those in which </span><span class="c-11">gender does not follow from sex and those in which the practices of desire do not “follow”
from either sex </span><span class="c-7">or gender.</span><span class="c-2"> “Follow” in this context is a political relation
of entailment instituted by the cultural laws that establish and regulate
the shape and meaning of sexuality. </span><span class="c-5">Indeed, precisely because certain
kinds of “gender identities” fail to conform to those norms of cultural
intelligibility, they appear only as developmental failures or logical
impossibilities </span><span class="c-3">from within that domain.</span><span class="c-1">Their </span><span class="c-3">persistence and proliferation, however, provide critical opportunities to expose the limits and
regulatory </span><span class="c-4">aims of that </span><span class="c-6">domain of intelligibility </span><span class="c-5">and, hence, to open up
within the very terms of that matrix </span><span class="c-3">of intelligibility rival and subversive </span><span class="c-2">matrices of gender disorder.</span><span class="c-0">
Before such disordering practices are considered, however, it seems
crucial to understand the “matrix of intelligibility.” Is it singular? Of
what is it composed? What is the peculiar alliance presumed to exist
between a system of compulsory heterosexuality and the discursive categories that establish the identity concepts of sex? If “identity” is an effect
of discursive practices, to what extent is gender identity, construed as a
relationship among sex, gender, sexual practice, and desire, the effect of
a regulatory practice that can be identified as compulsory heterosexuality? Would that explanation return us to yet another totalizing frame in
which compulsory heterosexuality merely takes the place of phallogocentrism as the monolithic cause of gender oppression?
Within the spectrum of French feminist and poststructuralist theory, very different regimes of power are understood to produce the
identity concepts of sex. Consider the divergence between those positions, such as Irigaray’s, that claim there is only one sex, the masculine,
that elaborates itself in and through the production of the “Other,” and
those positions, Foucault’s, for instance, that assume that the category
of sex, whether masculine or feminine, is a production of a diffuse regulatory economy of sexuality. Consider also Wittig’s argument that the
category of sex is, under the conditions of compulsory heterosexuality,
~
onymous with the “universal”).Wittig concurs, however paradoxically,
with Foucault in claiming that the category of sex would itself disappear and, indeed, dissipate through the disruption and displacement of
heterosexual hegemony.
The various explanatory models offered here suggest the very different ways in which the category of sex is understood depending on
how the field of power is articulated. Is it possible to maintain the complexity of these fields of power and think through their productive
capacities together? On the one hand, Irigaray’s theory of sexual difference suggests that </span><span class="c-2">women can never be understood on the model of a
“subject” within the conventional representational systems of Western
culture precisely because they constitute the fetish of representation
and, hence, the unrepresentable </span><span class="c-0">as such.Women can never “be,” according to this ontology of substances, precisely because they are the relation of difference, the excluded, by which that domain marks itself off.
Women are also a “difference” that cannot be understood as the simple
negation or “Other” of the always-already-masculine subject. As discussed earlier, they are neither the subject nor its Other, but a difference from the economy of binary opposition, itself a ruse for a
monologic elaboration of the masculine.
Central to each of these views, however, is the notion that sex
appears within hegemonic language as a substance, as, metaphysically
speaking, a self-identical being. This appearance is achieved through a
performative twist of language and/or discourse that conceals the fact
that “being” a sex or a gender is fundamentally impossible. For Irigaray,
grammar can never be a true index of gender relations precisely
because it supports the substantial model of gender as a binary relation
between two positive and representable terms.25 In Irigaray’s view, the
substantive grammar of gender, which assumes men and women as well
as their attributes of masculine and feminine, is an example of a binary
that effectively masks the univocal and hegemonic discourse of the masculine, phallogocentrism, silencing the feminine as a site of subversive
multiplicity. For Foucault, the substantive grammar of sex imposes an
~
artificial binary relation between the sexes, as well as an artificial internal coherence within each term of that binary.The </span><span class="c-2">binary regulation of
sexuality </span><span class="c-3">suppresses the subversive multiplicity of a sexuality that disrupts heterosexual, reproductive, and medicojuridical </span><span class="c-2">hegemonies.</span><span class="c-0">
For Wittig, the binary restriction on sex serves the reproductive
aims of a system of compulsory heterosexuality; occasionally, she
claims that the overthrow of compulsory heterosexuality will inaugurate a true humanism of “the person” freed from the shackles of sex. In
other contexts, she suggests that the profusion and diffusion of a nonphallocentric erotic economy will dispel the illusions of sex, gender,
and identity. At yet other textual moments it seems that “the lesbian”
emerges as a third gender that promises to transcend the binary
restriction on sex imposed by the system of compulsory heterosexuality. In her defense of the “cognitive subject,”Wittig appears to have no
metaphysical quarrel with hegemonic modes of signification or representation; indeed, the subject, with its attribute of self-determination,
appears to be <a name="b-10"></a>the rehabilitation of the agent of existential choice under
the name of the lesbian: “the advent of individual subjects demands
first destroying the categories of sex . . . the lesbian is the only concept
I know of which is beyond the categories of sex.”26 She does not criticize “the subject” as invariably masculine according to the rules of an
inevitably patriarchal Symbolic, but proposes in its place the equivalent of a lesbian subject as language-user.27
The identification of women with “sex,” for Beauvoir as for Wittig,
is a conflation of the category of women with the ostensibly sexualized
features of their bodies and, hence, a refusal to grant freedom and
autonomy to women as it is purportedly enjoyed by men. Thus, the
</span><span class="c-1">destruction of the category of sex would be the destruction of an
attribute, sex, that has, through a misogynist gesture of synecdoche,
come to take the place of the person, the self-determining cogito.</span><span class="c-0"> In
other words, only men are “persons,” and there is no gender but
the feminine:

~
Gender is the linguistic index of the political opposition between
the sexes. Gender is used here in the singular because indeed </span><span class="c-1">there
are not two genders.There is only one: the feminine, the “masculine”
not being a gender. For the masculine is not the masculine,</span><span class="c-0"> but the
general.28

Hence,Wittig calls for the destruction of “sex” so that women can
assume the status of a universal subject. On the way toward that
destruction, “women” must assume both a particular and a universal
point of view.29 As a subject who can realize concrete universality
through freedom, Wittig’s lesbian confirms rather than contests the
normative promise of humanist ideals premised on the metaphysics of
substance. In this respect, Wittig is distinguished from Irigaray, not
only in terms of the now familiar oppositions between essentialism and
materialism,30 but in terms of the adherence to a metaphysics of substance that confirms the normative model of humanism as the framework for feminism. Where it seems that Wittig has subscribed to a
radical project of lesbian emancipation and enforced a distinction
between “lesbian” and “woman,” she does this through the defense of
the pregendered “person,” characterized as freedom. This move not
only confirms the presocial status of human freedom, but </span><span class="c-2">subscribes to
that metaphysics of substance that is responsible for the production
and naturalization of the category of sex </span><span class="c-0">itself.
The metaphysics of substance is a phrase that is associated with
Nietzsche within the contemporary criticism of philosophical discourse. In a commentary on Nietzsche, Michel Haar argues that a
number of philosophical ontologies have been trapped within certain
illusions of “Being” and “Substance” that are fostered by the belief that
the grammatical formulation of subject and predicate reflects the prior
ontological reality of substance and attribute.These constructs, argues
Haar, constitute the artificial philosophical means by which simplicity,
order, and identity are effectively instituted. In no sense, however, do

~
they reveal or represent some true order of things. For our purposes,
this Nietzschean criticism becomes instructive when it is applied to the
psychological categories that govern much popular and theoretical
thinking about gender identity. According to Haar, the critique of the
metaphysics of substance implies a critique of the very notion of the
psychological person as a substantive thing:
The destruction of logic by means of its genealogy brings with it as
well the ruin of the psychological categories founded upon this logic.
</span><span class="c-1">All psychological categories (the ego, the individual, the person)
derive from the illusion of substantial identity. But this illusion goes
back basically to a superstition that deceives not only common sense
but also philosophers—namely, the belief in language and, more precisely, in the truth of grammatical categories. It was grammar (the
structure of subject and predicate) that inspired Descartes’ certainty
that “I” is the subject of “think,” whereas it is rather the thoughts that
come to “me”: at bottom, faith in grammar simply conveys the will to
be the “cause”</span><span class="c-0"> of one’s </span><span class="c-1">thoughts.The subject, the self, the individual,
are just so many false concepts, since they transform into substances
fictitious unities having at the start only a linguistic reality.</span><span class="c-0">31

Wittig provides an alternative critique by showing that persons
cannot be signified within language without the mark of gender. She
provides a political analysis of the grammar of gender in French.
According to Wittig, gender not only designates persons, “qualifies”
them, as it were, but constitutes a conceptual episteme by which binary
gender is universalized. Although French gives gender to all sorts of
nouns other than persons, Wittig argues that her analysis has consequences for English as well. At the outset of “The Mark of Gender”
(1984), she writes:
The mark of gender, according to grammarians, concerns substantives. They talk about it in terms of function. If they question its
meaning, they may joke about it, calling gender a “fictive sex.” . . . as

~
far as the categories of the person are concerned, both [English and
French] are bearers of gender to the same extent. Both indeed give
way to a primitive ontological concept that enforces in language a
division of beings into sexes. . . . As an ontological concept that deals
with the nature of Being, along with a whole nebula of other primitive concepts belonging to the same line of thought, gender seems to
belong primarily to philosophy.32

For gender to “belong to philosophy” is, for Wittig, to belong to
“that body of self-evident concepts without which philosophers believe
they cannot develop a line of reasoning and which for them go without
saying, for they exist prior to any thought, any social order, in
nature.”33 Wittig’s view is corroborated by that popular discourse on
gender identity that uncritically employs the inflectional attribution of
“being” to genders and to “sexualities.” The unproblematic claim to
“be” a woman and “be” heterosexual would be symptomatic of that
metaphysics of gender substances. In the case of both “men” and
“women,” this claim tends to subordinate the notion of gender under
that of identity and to lead to the conclusion that a person is a gender
and is one in virtue of his or her sex, psychic sense of self, and various
expressions of that psychic self, the most salient being that of sexual
desire. In such a prefeminist context, gender, naively (rather than critically) confused with sex, serves as a unifying principle of the embodied self and maintains that unity over and against an “opposite sex”
whose structure is presumed to maintain a parallel but oppositional
internal coherence among sex, gender, and desire. The </span><span class="c-1">articulation “I
feel like a woman” by a female or “I feel like a man” by a male presupposes that in neither case is the claim meaninglessly redundant.</span><span class="c-0">
Although it might appear unproblematic to be a given anatomy
(although we shall later consider the way in which that project is also
fraught with difficulty), the experience of a gendered psychic disposition or cultural identity is considered an achievement.Thus, “I feel like
a woman” is true to the extent that Aretha Franklin’s invocation of the
~
defining Other is assumed: “You make me feel like a natural woman.”34
This achievement requires a differentiation from the opposite gender.
Hence, one is one’s </span><span class="c-4">gender to the extent that one is not the other gender, a formulation that presupposes and enforces the restriction of
gender within that binary pair.</span><span class="c-3">
</span><span class="c-4">Gender </span><span class="c-1">can denote a </span><span class="c-3">unity of experience, of </span><span class="c-4">sex, gender, and
desire, only when sex can be understood in some sense to necessitate
gender—</span><span class="c-1">where gender is a psychic and/or cultural designation of the
self—and desire—where desire is heterosexual and therefore differentiates itself through an oppositional relation to that other gender it
desires.</span><span class="c-0"> The </span><span class="c-4">internal coherence or unity of either gender, man or
woman, thereby requires both a stable and oppositional heterosexuality.</span><span class="c-2"> That </span><span class="c-3">institutional heterosexuality both requires and produces the
univocity of each of the gendered terms that constitute the limit of
gendered possibilities within an oppositional, binary </span><span class="c-2">gender system.</span><span class="c-1">
This </span><span class="c-0">conception of gender presupposes not only a causal relation
among sex, gender, and desire, but suggests as well that desire reflects
or expresses gender and that gender reflects or expresses desire. The
metaphysical unity of the three is assumed to be truly known and
expressed in a differentiating desire for an oppositional gender—that
is, in a form of oppositional heterosexuality. Whether as a naturalistic
paradigm which establishes a causal continuity among sex, gender, and
desire, or as an authentic-expressive paradigm in which some true self
is said to be revealed simultaneously or successively in sex, gender, and
desire, here “the old dream of symmetry,” as Irigaray has called it, is
presupposed, reified, and rationalized.
This rough sketch of gender gives us a clue to understanding
the political reasons for the substantializing view of gender. The </span><span class="c-2">institution of a compulsory and naturalized heterosexuality requires and
regulates </span><span class="c-4">gender as a binary relation in which the masculine term is
differentiated from a feminine term, and this differentiation is accomplished through the practices of heterosexual desire.</span><span class="c-2"> The act of differentiating the two oppositional moments of the binary results in a
~
consolidation of each term, the respective internal coherence of sex,
gender, and desire.</span><span class="c-0">
The strategic displacement of that binary relation and the metaphysics of substance on which it relies presuppose that the categories
of female and male, woman and man, are similarly produced within
the binary frame. Foucault implicitly subscribes to such an explanation. In the closing chapter of the first volume of The History of Sexuality
and in his brief but significant introduction to Herculine Barbin, Being the
Recently Discovered Journals of a Nineteenth-Century Hermaphrodite,35
Foucault suggests that the category of sex, prior to any categorization
of sexual difference, is itself constructed through a historically specific
mode of sexuality. The tactical production of the discrete and binary
categorization of sex conceals the strategic aims of that very apparatus
of production by postulating “sex” as “a cause” of sexual experience,
behavior, and desire. </span><span class="c-1">Foucault’s genealogical inquiry exposes this
ostensible “cause” as “an effect,” the production of a given regime of
sexuality that seeks to regulate sexual experience by instating </span><span class="c-0">the discrete </span><span class="c-1">categories of sex as foundational and causal functions within any
discursive account of sexuality.</span><span class="c-0">
Foucault’s introduction to the journals of the hermaphrodite,
Herculine Barbin, suggests that the <a name="b-11"></a>genealogical critique of these reified categories of sex is the inadvertent consequence of sexual practices that cannot be accounted for within the medicolegal discourse of
a naturalized heterosexuality. Herculine is not an “identity,” but the
sexual impossibility of an identity. Although male and female anatomical elements are jointly distributed in and on this body, that is not the
true source of scandal.The </span><span class="c-1">linguistic conventions that produce intelligible gendered selves find their limit in Herculine precisely because
she/he occasions a convergence and disorganization of the rules that
govern sex/gender/desire.</span><span class="c-0"> Herculine deploys and redistributes the
terms of a binary system, but that very redistribution disrupts and proliferates those terms outside the binary itself. According to Foucault,
Herculine is not categorizable within the gender binary as it stands; the
~
disconcerting convergence of heterosexuality and homosexuality in
her/his person are only occasioned, but never caused, by his/her
anatomical discontinuity. Foucault’s appropriation of Herculine is suspect,36 but his analysis implies the interesting belief that sexual heterogeneity (paradoxically foreclosed by a naturalized “hetero”-sexuality)
implies a critique of the metaphysics of substance as it informs the
identitarian categories of sex. Foucault imagines Herculine’s experience as “a world of pleasures in which grins hang about without the
cat.”37 Smiles, happinesses, pleasures, and desires are figured here as
qualities without an abiding substance to which they are said to adhere.
As free-floating attributes, they suggest the possibility of a gendered
experience that cannot be grasped through the substantializing and
hierarchizing grammar of nouns (res extensa) and adjectives (attributes,
essential and accidental). Through his cursory reading of Herculine,
</span><span class="c-1">Foucault proposes an ontology of accidental attributes that exposes the
postulation of identity as a culturally restricted principle of order and
hierarchy, a regulatory fiction.</span><span class="c-0">
If it is possible to speak of a “man” with a masculine attribute and
to understand that attribute as a happy but accidental feature of that
man, then it is also possible to speak of a “man” with a feminine
attribute, whatever that is, but still to maintain the integrity of the
gender. But </span><span class="c-1">once we dispense with the priority of “man” and “woman”
as abiding substances, then it is no longer possible to subordinate dissonant gendered features as so many secondary and accidental characteristics of a gender ontology that is fundamentally intact. If the notion
of an abiding substance is a fictive construction produced through the
compulsory ordering of attributes into coherent gender sequences,
then it seems that gender as substance, the viability of man and woman
as nouns, is called into question by the dissonant play of attributes that
fail to conform to sequential or causal models of intelligibility.</span><span class="c-0">
The appearance of an abiding substance or gendered self, what the
psychiatrist Robert Stoller refers to as a “gender core,”38 is thus </span><span class="c-1">produced by the regulation of attributes along culturally established lines
~
of coherence.</span><span class="c-0"> As a result, the exposure of this fictive production is
conditioned by the deregulated play of attributes that resist assimilation into the ready made framework of primary nouns and subordinate adjectives. It is of course always possible to argue that dissonant
adjectives work retroactively to redefine the substantive identities they
are said to modify and, hence, to expand the substantive categories of
gender to include possibilities that they previously excluded. But if
these substances are nothing other than the coherences contingently
created through the regulation of attributes, it would seem that the
ontology of substances itself is not only an artificial effect, but essentially superfluous.
In </span><span class="c-1">this sense, gender is not a noun, but neither is it a set of freefloating </span><span class="c-7">attributes, for we have seen that the </span><span class="c-10">substantive effect of </span><span class="c-11">gender is performatively produced and compelled by the regulatory
practices of gender coherence.</span><span class="c-6"> </span><span class="c-8">Hence,</span><span class="c-7"> </span><span class="c-10">within the inherited discourse
of the metaphysics of substance, </span><span class="c-13">gender proves to be performative—
that is, constituting the identity it is purported </span><span class="c-9">to be. In </span><span class="c-10">this sense,
</span><span class="c-19">gender is always </span><span class="c-16">a doing, though not a doing by a subject who might be
said to preexist </span><span class="c-13">the deed.</span><span class="c-0"> The challenge for rethinking gender categories outside of the metaphysics of substance will have to consider the
relevance of Nietzsche’s claim in On the Genealogy of Morals that “</span><span class="c-2">there
is no ‘being’ </span><span class="c-4">behind doing, effecting, becoming; ‘the </span><span class="c-6">doer’ is merely a
fiction added to the deed—</span><span class="c-4">the deed is everything.</span><span class="c-0">”39 In an application
that Nietzsche himself would not have anticipated or condoned, we
</span><span class="c-1">might state as a corollary: </span><span class="c-47">There is no </span><span class="c-57">gender </span><span class="c-58">identity </span><span class="c-61">behind the
</span><span class="c-63">expressions of </span><span class="c-64">gender; that </span><span class="c-67">identity </span><span class="c-65">is performatively </span><span class="c-61">constituted </span><span class="c-59">by
the very “expressions” that are said </span><span class="c-23">to be its results.</span><span class="c-0">
vi. Language, Power, and the Strategies of
Displacement
A great deal of feminist theory and literature has nevertheless assumed that there is a “doer” behind the deed. Without an agent, it is
argued, there can be no agency and hence no potential to initiate a
~
transformation of relations of domination within society.Wittig’s radical feminist theory occupies an ambiguous position within the continuum of theories on the question of the subject. On the one hand,Wittig
appears to dispute the metaphysics of substance, but on the other
hand, she retains the human subject, the individual, as the metaphysical
locus of agency. While Wittig’s humanism clearly presupposes that
there is a doer behind the deed, her theory nevertheless delineates the
performative construction of gender within the material practices of
culture, disputing the temporality of those explanations that would
confuse “cause” with “result.” In a phrase that suggests the intertextual
space that links Wittig with Foucault (and reveals the traces of the
Marxist notion of reification in both of their theories), she writes:
A </span><span class="c-1">materialist feminist approach shows that what we take for the
cause or origin of oppression is in fact only the mark imposed by the
oppressor; the “myth of woman,” plus its material effects and manifestations in the appropriated consciousness and bodies of women.</span><span class="c-0">
Thus, this mark does not preexist oppression . . . sex is taken as
an “immediate given,” a “sensible given,” “physical features,” belonging
to a natural order. But what we believe to be a physical and direct
perception is only a sophisticated and mythic construction, an “imaginary formation.”40

Because this production of “nature” operates in accord with the dictates of compulsory heterosexuality, the emergence of homosexual
desire, in her view, transcends the categories of sex: “If desire could
liberate itself, it would have nothing to do with the preliminary marking by sexes.”41
Wittig refers to “sex” as a mark that is somehow applied by an
institutionalized heterosexuality, a mark that can be erased or obfuscated through practices that effectively contest that institution. Her
view, of course, differs radically from Irigaray’s. The latter would
understand the “mark” of gender to be part of the hegemonic signifying
economy of the masculine that operates through the self-elaborating
~
mechanisms of specularization that have virtually determined the field
of ontology within the Western philosophical tradition. For Wittig,
language is an instrument or tool that is in no way misogynist in its
structures, but only in its applications.42 For Irigaray, the possibility of
another language or signifying economy is the only chance at escaping
the “mark” of gender which, for the feminine, is nothing but the phallogocentric erasure of the female sex.Whereas Irigaray seeks to expose
the ostensible “binary” relation between the sexes as a masculinist ruse
that excludes the feminine altogether,Wittig argues that positions like
Irigaray’s reconsolidate the binary between masculine and feminine
and recirculate a mythic notion of the feminine. Clearly drawing on
Beauvoir’s critique of the myth of the feminine in The Second Sex,Wittig
asserts, “there is no ‘feminine writing.’”43
Wittig is clearly attuned to the power of language to subordinate
and exclude women. As a “materialist,” however, she considers language
to be “another order of materiality,”44 an institution that can be radically
transformed. Language ranks among the concrete and contingent practices and institutions maintained by the choices of individuals and,
hence, weakened by the collective actions of choosing individuals. The
linguistic fiction of “sex,” she argues, is a category produced and circulated by the system of compulsory heterosexuality in an effort to
restrict the production of identities along the axis of heterosexual
desire. In some of her work, both male and female homosexuality, as
well as other positions independent of the heterosexual contract, provide the occasion either for the overthrow or the proliferation of the
category of sex. In The Lesbian Body and elsewhere, however, Wittig
appears to take issue with genitally organized sexuality per se and to call
for an alternative economy of pleasures which would both contest the
construction of female subjectivity marked by women’s supposedly distinctive reproductive function.45 Here the proliferation of pleasures
outside the reproductive economy suggests both a specifically feminine
form of erotic diffusion, understood as a counterstrategy to the reproductive construction of genitality. In a sense, The Lesbian Body can be
~
understood, for Wittig, as an “inverted” reading of Freud’s Three Essays on
the Theory of Sexuality, in which he argues for the developmental superiority of genital sexuality over and against the less restricted and more
diffuse infantile sexuality. Only the “invert,” the medical classification
invoked by Freud for “the homosexual,” fails to “achieve” the genital
norm. In waging a political critique against genitality,Wittig appears to
deploy “inversion” as a critical reading practice, valorising precisely
those features of an undeveloped sexuality designated by Freud and
effectively inaugurating a “post-genital politics.”46 Indeed, the notion of
development can be read only as normalization within the heterosexual
matrix. And yet, is this the only reading of Freud possible? And to what
extent is Wittig’s practice of “inversion” committed to the very model of
normalization that she seeks to dismantle? In other words, if the model
of a more diffuse and antigenital sexuality serves as the singular, oppositional alternative to the hegemonic structure of sexuality, to what
extent is that binary relation fated to reproduce itself endlessly? What
possibility exists for the disruption of the oppositional binary itself?
Wittig’s oppositio<a name="b-12"></a>nal relationship to psychoanalysis produces the
unexpected consequence that her theory presumes precisely that psychoanalytic theory of development, now fully “inverted,” that she seeks
to overcome. Polymorphous perversity, assumed to exist prior to the
marking by sex, is valorised as the telos of human sexuality.47 One possible feminist psychoanalytic response to Wittig might argue that she
both undertheorizes and underestimates the meaning and function of
the language in which “the mark of gender” occurs. She understands
that marking practice as contingent, radically variable, and even dispensable. The status of a primary prohibition in Lacanian theory operates more forcefully and less contingently than the notion of a
regulatory practice in Foucault or a materialist account of a system of
heterosexist oppression in Wittig.
In Lacan, as in Irigaray’s post-Lacanian reformulation of Freud,
sexual difference is not a simple binary that retains the metaphysics of
~
struction </span><span class="c-2">produced by the law that prohibits incest and forces an infinite displacement of a heterosexualizing </span><span class="c-4">desire.The feminine is never a
mark of the subject; the feminine could not be an “attribute” of a gender. Rather, the feminine is the signification of lack, signified by the
Symbolic, a set of differentiating linguistic rules that effectively create
sexual </span><span class="c-2">difference.</span><span class="c-0">The masculine linguistic position undergoes individuation and heterosexualization required by the founding prohibitions
of the Symbolic law, the law of the Father. The incest taboo that bars
the son from the mother and thereby instates the kinship relation
between them is a law enacted “in the name of the Father.” Similarly,
the law that refuses the girl’s desire for both her mother and father
requires that she take up the emblem of maternity and perpetuate the
rules of kinship. Both masculine and feminine positions are thus instituted through prohibitive laws that produce culturally intelligible genders, but only through the production of an unconscious sexuality that
reemerges in the domain of the imaginary.48
The feminist appropriation of sexual difference, whether written in
opposition to the phallogocentrism of Lacan (Irigaray) or as a critical
reelaboration of Lacan, </span><span class="c-2">attempts to theorize the feminine, not as an
expression of the metaphysics of substance, but as the unrepresentable
absence effected by (masculine) denial that grounds the signifying economy through exclusion.The feminine as the repudiated/excluded within that system constitutes the possibility of a critique and disruption of
that hegemonic conceptual scheme.</span><span class="c-0">The works of Jacqueline Rose49 and
Jane Gallop50 underscore in different ways the </span><span class="c-1">constructed status of
sexual difference, the inherent instability of that construction, and the
dual consequentiality of a prohibition that at once institutes a sexual
identity and provides for the exposure of that construction’s tenuous
ground.</span><span class="c-0"> Although Wittig and other materialist feminists within the
French context would argue that sexual difference is an unthinking
replication of a reified set of sexed polarities, these criticisms </span><span class="c-1">neglect
the critical dimension of the unconscious which, as a site of repressed
sexuality, reemerges within the discourse of the subject as the very
~
impossibility of its coherence.</span><span class="c-0"> As Rose points out very clearly, the </span><span class="c-1">construction of a coherent sexual identity along the disjunctive axis of the
feminine/masculine is bound to fail;51 the disruptions of this coherence
through the inadvertent reemergence of the repressed reveal not only
that “identity” is constructed, but that the </span><span class="c-2">prohibition that constructs
identity is inefficacious (the paternal law ought to be </span><span class="c-4">understood not as
a deterministic divine will, but as a perpetual bumbler,</span><span class="c-3"> preparing the
ground for the insurrections </span><span class="c-0">against him).
The differences between the materialist and Lacanian (and postLacanian) positions emerge in a normative quarrel over whether there
is a retrievable sexuality either “before” or “outside” the law in the
mode of the unconscious or “after” the law as a postgenital sexuality.
Paradoxically, the normative trope of polymorphous perversity is
understood to characterize both views of alternative sexuality.There is
no agreement, however, on the manner of delimiting that “law” or set
of “laws.” The psychoanalytic critique succeeds in giving an account of
the construction of “the subject”—and perhaps also the illusion of
substance—within the matrix of normative gender relations. In her
existential-materialist mode,Wittig presumes the subject, the person,
to have a presocial and pregendered integrity. On the other hand, “the
paternal Law” in Lacan, as well as the monologic mastery of phallogocentrism in Irigaray, bear the mark of a monotheistic singularity that is
perhaps less unitary and culturally universal than the guiding structuralist assumptions of the account presume.52
But the quarrel seems also to turn on the articulation of a temporal
trope of a subversive sexuality that flourishes prior to the imposition of a
law, after its overthrow, or during its reign as a constant challenge to its
authority. Here it seems wise to reinvoke Foucault who, in claiming that
sexuality and power are coextensive, implicitly refutes the postulation
of a subversive or emancipatory sexuality which could be free of the
law.We can press the argument further by pointing out that “the before”
of the law and “the after” are discursively and performatively instituted
modes of temporality that are invoked within the terms of a normative
~
framework which asserts that subversion, destabilization, or displacement requires a sexuality that somehow escapes the hegemonic prohibitions on sex. For Foucault, those prohibitions are invariably and
inadvertently productive in the sense that “the subject” who is supposed
to be founded and produced in and through those prohibitions does not
have access to a sexuality that is in some sense “outside,” “before,” or
“after” power itself. Power, rather than the law, encompasses both the
juridical (prohibitive and regulatory) and the productive (inadvertently
generative) functions of differential relations. Hence, the </span><span class="c-2">sexuality that
emerges within the matrix of power relations is not a simple replication
or copy of the law itself, a uniform repetition of a masculinist economy
of identity. The </span><span class="c-3">productions swerve from their original purposes and
inadvertently mobilize </span><span class="c-4">possibilities of “subjects” that do not merely
exceed the bounds of cultural intelligibility, but effectively expand the
boundaries of what is, in fact, culturally </span><span class="c-3">intelligible.</span><span class="c-0">
The feminist norm of a postgenital sexuality became the object of
significant criticism from feminist theorists of sexuality, some of whom
have sought a specifically feminist and/or lesbian appropriation of
Foucault. This utopian notion of a sexuality freed from heterosexual
constructs, a sexuality beyond “sex,” </span><span class="c-1">failed to acknowledge the ways in
which power relations continue to construct sexuality for women even
within the terms of a “liberated” heterosexuality or lesbianism.53 The
same criticism is waged against the notion of a specifically feminine sexual pleasure that is radically </span><span class="c-0">differentiated from phallic sexuality.
Irigaray’s occasional efforts to derive a specific feminine sexuality from
a specific female anatomy have been the focus of anti-essentialist arguments for some time.54 The </span><span class="c-1">return to biology as the ground of a specific
feminine sexuality or meaning seems to defeat the feminist premise that
biology is not destiny.</span><span class="c-0"> But whether feminine sexuality is articulated here
through a discourse of biology for purely strategic reasons,55 or whether
it is, in fact, a feminist return to biological essentialism, the characterization of female sexuality as radically distinct from a phallic organization
of sexuality remains problematic. Women who fail either to recognize
~
that sexuality as their own or understand their sexuality as partially constructed within the terms of the phallic economy are potentially written
off within the terms of that theory as “male-identified” or “unenlightened.” Indeed, it is often unclear within Irigaray’s text whether sexuality
is culturally constructed, or whether it is only culturally constructed
within the terms of the phallus. In other words, is specifically feminine
pleasure “outside” of culture as its prehistory or as its utopian future? If
so, of what use is such a notion for negotiating the contemporary struggles of sexuality within the terms of its construction?
The </span><span class="c-2">pro-sexuality movement within feminist theory and practice
has effectively argued that </span><span class="c-3">sexuality is always constructed within the
terms of discourse and power, where power is partially understood in
terms of heterosexual and phallic cultural conventions.</span><span class="c-2">The emergence
of a sexuality constructed (not determined) in these terms within lesbian, bisexual, and heterosexual contexts is, therefore, not a sign of a
masculine identification in some reductive sense. It is not the failed
project of criticizing phallogocentrism or heterosexual hegemony,</span><span class="c-0"> as if
a political critique could effectively undo the cultural construction of
the feminist critic’s sexuality. If </span><span class="c-6">sexuality is culturally constructed
within existing power relations, then the </span><span class="c-7">postulation of a normative
sexuality that is “before,” “outside,” or “beyond” power is a </span><span class="c-8">cultural
impossibility and a politically impracticable dream,</span><span class="c-6"> one that postpones
the concrete and contemporary task of rethinking subversive possibilities </span><span class="c-5">for sexuality and identity within the terms of power </span><span class="c-2">itself. This
critical task presumes, of course, that to </span><span class="c-3">operate within the matrix of
power is not the same as to replicate uncritically relations of domination.</span><span class="c-2"> It offers the possibility of a repetition of the law which is not its
consolidation, but its displacement.</span><span class="c-0"> In the place of a “male-identified”
sexuality in which “male” serves as the cause and irreducible meaning
of that sexuality, we might develop a notion of sexuality constructed in
terms of phallic relations of power that replay and redistribute the possibilities of that phallicism precisely through the subversive operation of
“identifications” that are, within the power field of sexuality, inevitable.
~
If “identifications,” following Jacqueline Rose, can be exposed as phantasmatic, then it must be possible to enact an identification that displays
its phantasmatic structure. If </span><span class="c-1">there is no </span><span class="c-3">radical repudiation of a culturally constructed sexuality, what is left is the question of how to
acknowledge </span><span class="c-1">and “do” the construction one is invariably in. Are there
forms of repetition that do not constitute a simple imitation, reproduction, and, hence, consolidation of the law </span><span class="c-0">(the anachronistic notion of
“male identification” that ought to be discarded from a feminist vocabulary)? What possibilities of gender configurati<a name="b-13"></a>ons exist among the various emergent and occasionally convergent matrices of cultural
intelligibility that govern gendered life?
Within the terms of feminist sexual theory, it is clear that the presence of power dynamics within sexuality is in no sense the same as the
simple consolidation or augmentation of a heterosexist or phallogocentric power regime. The “</span><span class="c-1">presence” of so-</span><span class="c-2">called heterosexual conventions within homosexual contexts as well </span><span class="c-1">as the proliferation of
specifically gay discourses of sexual difference, as in the case of “butch”
and “femme” as historical identities of sexual style, cannot be explained
as chimerical representations of originally heterosexual identities. And
neither can they be understood as the pernicious insistence of heterosexist constructs within gay sexuality and identity. The repetition of
heterosexual constructs within sexual cultures both gay and straight
</span><span class="c-2">may well be the inevitable site of the denaturalization and mobilization
of gender categories.</span><span class="c-0"> The </span><span class="c-4">replication of </span><span class="c-7">heterosexual constructs in
non-heterosexual frames </span><span class="c-10">brings into relief the </span><span class="c-11">utterly constructed
status of the so-called heterosexual original.</span><span class="c-7">Thus, gay is to straight not
as copy is to original, but, rather, as copy is to copy.</span><span class="c-5">The parodic repetition </span><span class="c-0">of “the original,” discussed in the final sections of chapter 3 of
this text, </span><span class="c-7">reveals the original to be nothing other than a parody of the
idea of the natural </span><span class="c-6">and the original.</span><span class="c-0">56 Even if heterosexist constructs
circulate as the available sites of power/discourse from which to do
gender at all, the question remains: What possibilities of recirculation
exist? Which possibilities of doing gender repeat and displace through
~
hyperbole, dissonance, internal confusion, and proliferation the very
constructs by which they are mobilized?
Consider not only that the ambiguities and incoherences within and
among heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual practices </span><span class="c-2">are suppressed and redescribed within the reified framework of the disjunctive
and asymmetrical binary of masculine/feminine,</span><span class="c-0"> but that these cultural
configurations of gender confusion operate as sites for intervention,
exposure, and displacement of these reifications. In other words, the
“unity” of </span><span class="c-1">gender is the effect of a regulatory practice that seeks to render gender identity uniform through a compulsory heterosexuality.The
force </span><span class="c-0">of this practice is, through an exclusionary apparatus of production, to restrict the relative meanings of “heterosexuality,” “homosexuality,” and “bisexuality” as well as the subversive sites of their
convergence and resignification. That the power regimes of heterosexism and phallogocentrism seek to augment themselves through a constant repetition of their logic, their </span><span class="c-1">metaphysic, and their naturalized
ontologies does not imply that repetition itself ought to be stopped—as
if it could </span><span class="c-0">be. If </span><span class="c-3">repetition is bound to persist as the mechanism of the
cultural reproduction of identities,</span><span class="c-2"> then the crucial question emerges:
What </span><span class="c-3">kind of subversive repetition might call into question the regulatory practice of identity </span><span class="c-0">itself?
If there is no recourse to a “person,” a “sex,” or a “sexuality” that
</span><span class="c-1">escapes the matrix of power and discursive relations that effectively
produce and regulate the intelligibility of those concepts for us, what
constitutes the possibility </span><span class="c-0">of effective inversion, subversion, or displacement within the terms of a constructed identity? What possibilities exist by virtue of the constructed character of sex and gender?
Whereas Foucault is ambiguous about the precise character of the “regulatory practices” that produce the category of sex, and Wittig appears
to invest the full responsibility of the construction to sexual reproduction and its instrument, compulsory heterosexuality, yet other discourses converge to produce this categorial fiction for reasons not
always clear or consistent with one another. The power relations that
~
infuse the biological sciences are not easily reduced, and the medicolegal alliance emerging in nineteenth-century Europe has spawned categorial fictions that could not be anticipated in advance. The very
</span><span class="c-1">complexity of the discursive map that constructs gender appears to
hold out the promise of an inadvertent and generative convergence of
these discursive and regulatory structures. If the </span><span class="c-2">regulatory fictions of
sex and gender are themselves multiply contested sites of meaning,
then the very multiplicity of their construction holds out the possibility
of a disruption of their univocal posturing.</span><span class="c-0">
</span><span class="c-1">Clearly this project does not propose to lay out within traditional
philosophical terms an ontology of gender whereby the meaning of being
a woman or a man is elucidated within the terms of phenomenology.
The presumption here is that the “being” of gender is an effect, an object
of a genealogical investigation that maps out the political parameters of
its construction in the mode of ontology. To </span><span class="c-2">claim </span><span class="c-1">that gender is constructed is not to assert its illusoriness or artificiality, where those
terms are understood to reside within a binary that counterposes the
“real” and the “authentic” as oppositional.</span><span class="c-0"> As a genealogy of gender
ontology, this inquiry seeks to understand the discursive production of
the plausibility of that binary relation and to suggest that certain cultural configurations of gender take the place of “the real” and consolidate
and augment their hegemony through that felicitous self-naturalization.
If </span><span class="c-4">there is something right in </span><span class="c-5">Beauvoir’s claim that one is not </span><span class="c-6">born,
but rather becomes a woman, it </span><span class="c-7">follows that </span><span class="c-10">woman itself is a </span><span class="c-12">term in
process, a becoming,</span><span class="c-10"> a constructing that </span><span class="c-11">cannot rightfully be </span><span class="c-12">said to
originate </span><span class="c-10">or to end.</span><span class="c-6">As an ongoing discursive practice, it is open to intervention </span><span class="c-5">and resignification.</span><span class="c-0"> Even when gender seems to congeal into the
most reified forms, the “congealing” is itself an insistent and insidious
practice, sustained and regulated by various social means. It is, for
Beauvoir, never possible finally to become a woman, as if there were a
telos that governs the process of acculturation and </span><span class="c-1">construction. </span><span class="c-40">Gender
is the </span><span class="c-51">repeated stylization of the </span><span class="c-55">body, a </span><span class="c-59">set of repeated acts </span><span class="c-58">within a
highly </span><span class="c-57">rigid regulatory frame </span><span class="c-54">that </span><span class="c-57">congeal </span><span class="c-59">over time to produce </span><span class="c-58">the

appearance </span><span class="c-56">of substance,</span><span class="c-53"> of a natural </span><span class="c-52">sort </span><span class="c-3">of being. A </span><span class="c-4">political genealogy
</span><span class="c-3">of gender ontologies, if it is successful, will deconstruct the substantive
appearance of gender into its constitutive acts and </span><span class="c-4">locate and account for
those acts within the compulsory frames </span><span class="c-3">set </span><span class="c-2">by the various forces that
police the social appearance of gender.</span><span class="c-0">To expose the contingent acts that
create the appearance of a naturalistic necessity, a move which has been a
part of cultural critique at least since Marx, is a task that now takes on
the added burden of showing how the very notion of the subject, intelligible only through its appearance as gendered, admits of possibilities that
have been forcibly foreclosed by the various reifications of gender that
have constituted its contingent ontologies.
The following chapter investigates some aspects of the psychoanalytic structuralist account of sexual difference and the construction of
sexuality with respect to its power to contest the regulatory regimes
outlined here as well as its role in uncritically reproducing those
regimes.The </span><span class="c-1">univocity of sex, the internal coherence of gender, and the

</span><span class="c-2">regulatory fictions that consolidate and naturalize the convergent power
regimes of masculine and heterosexist oppression.</span><span class="c-0"> The final chapter

Prohibition,</span><span class="c-0"> Psychoanalysis,
and the Production
of the Heterosexual Matrix
The straight mind continues to affirm that incest, and not homosexuality
represents its major interdiction.Thus, when thought by the straight
mind, homosexuality is nothing but heterosexuality.
—Monique Wittig, “The Straight Mind”

On occasion feminist theory has been drawn to the thought of an origin,
a time before what some would call “patriarchy” that would provide an
imaginary perspective from which to establish the contingency of the
history of women’s oppression. Debates have emerged over whether
prepatriarchal cultures have existed, whether they were matriarchal or
matrilineal in structure, whether patriarchy could be shown to have a
beginning and, hence, be subject to an end. The critical impetus behind
these kinds of inquiry sought understandably to show that the antifeminist argument in favor of the inevitability of patriarchy constituted a
reification and naturalization of a historical and contingent phenomenon.
Although the turn to a prepatriarchal state of culture was intended
to expose the self-reification of patriarchy, that prepatriarchal scheme
has proven to be a different sort of reification. More recently, some
feminists have offered a reflexive critique of some reified constructs
within feminism itself. The very notion of “</span><span class="c-2">patriarchy” has </span><span class="c-3">threatened
to become a universalizing concept that overrides or reduces </span><span class="c-4">distinct
~
articulations of gender asymmetry in different cultural contexts.</span><span class="c-0"> As
feminism has sought to become integrally related to struggles against
racial and colonialist oppression, it has become increasingly important
to resist the colonizing epistemological strategy that would subordinate different configurations of domination under the rubric of a transcultural notion of patriarchy.The articulation of the law of patriarchy
as a repressive and regulatory structure also requires reconsideration
from this critical perspective. The feminist recourse to an imaginary
</span><span class="c-2">past needs to be cautious not to promote a politically problematic
reification </span><span class="c-0">of women’s experience in the course of debunking the selfreifying claims of masculinist power.
The self-justification of a repressive or subordinating law almost
always grounds itself in a story about what it was like before the advent of<a name="b-14"></a>
the law, and how it came about that the law emerged in its present and
necessary form.1 The </span><span class="c-2">fabrication of those origins tends to describe a
state of affairs before the law that follows a necessary and unilinear narrative that culminates in, and thereby justifies, the constitution of the
law.The story of origins is thus a strategic tactic within a narrative that,
by telling a single, authoritative account </span><span class="c-0">about an irrecoverable past,
makes the constitution of the law appear as a historical inevitability.
Some feminists have found in the prejuridical </span><span class="c-2">past traces of a
utopian future, a potential resource for subversion or insurrection that
promises to lead to the destruction of the law and the instatement of a
new order. But if the imaginary “before” is inevitably figured within the
terms of a prehistorical narrative that serves to legitimate the present
state of the law or, alternatively, the imaginary future beyond the law,
then this “before” is always already imbued with the self-justificatory
fabrications of present and future interests, whether feminist or
antifeminist. The postulation of the “before” </span><span class="c-3">within feminist theory
becomes politically problematic when it constrains the future to materialize an idealized notion of the past </span><span class="c-2">or when it supports, even inadvertently,</span><span class="c-0"> the reification of a precultural sphere of the authentic
~
gic and </span><span class="c-1">parochial ideal that refuses the contemporary demand to formulate an account of gender as a complex cultural construction. This
ideal tends not only to serve culturally conservative aims, but to constitute an exclusionary practice within feminism, precipitating precisely the kind of fragmentation that the ideal purports </span><span class="c-0">to overcome.
Throughout the speculation of Engels, socialist feminism, those
feminist positions rooted in structuralist anthropology, there emerge
various efforts to locate moments or structures within history or culture that establish gender hierarchy.The isolation of such structures or
key periods is pursued in order to repudiate those reactionary theories
which would naturalize or universalize the subordination of women.
As significant efforts to provide a critical displacement of the universalizing gestures of oppression, these theories constitute part of the
contemporary theoretical field in which a further contestation of
oppression is taking place.The question needs to be pursued, however,
whether these powerful critiques of gender hierarchy make use of presuppositional fictions that entail problematic normative ideals.
Lévi-Strauss’s structuralist anthropology, including the problematic nature/culture distinction, has been appropriated by some feminist
theorists to support and elucidate the sex/gender distinction: the </span><span class="c-2">position that there is a natural or biological female who is subsequently
transformed into a socially subordinate “woman,” with the consequence that “sex” is to nature or “the raw” as gender is to culture </span><span class="c-0">or
“the cooked.” If Lévi-Strauss’s framework were true, it would be possible to trace the transformation of sex into gender by locating that stable mechanism of cultures, the exchange rules of kinship, which effect
that transformation in fairly regular ways. Within such a view, “sex” is
before the law in the sense that it is culturally and political undetermined, providing the “raw material” of culture, as it were, that begins
to signify only through and after its subjection to the rules of kinship.
This very concept of sex-as-matter, sex-as-instrument-of-culturalsignification, however, is a </span><span class="c-1">discursive formation that acts as a naturalized
foundation for the nature/culture distinction </span><span class="c-0">and the strategies of
~
domination that that distinction supports. The </span><span class="c-1">binary relation between
culture and nature </span><span class="c-2">promotes a relationship of hierarchy in which
culture freely “imposes” meaning on nature, and, hence,</span><span class="c-1"> renders it
into an “Other” to be appropriated to its own limitless uses,</span><span class="c-0"> safeguarding the ideality of the signifier and the structure of signification on the
model of domination.
Anthropologists Marilyn Strathern and Carol MacCormack have
argued that </span><span class="c-2">nature/culture discourse regularly figures nature as
female, in need of subordination by a culture that is invariably figured
as male, active, and abstract.2 As in the existential dialectic of misogyny, this is yet another instance in which </span><span class="c-3">reason and mind are associated
with masculinity and agency, while the body and nature are considered
to be the mute facticity of the feminine, awaiting signification from an
opposing masculine subject.</span><span class="c-2"> As in that misogynist dialectic, materiality
and meaning are mutually exclusive terms.</span><span class="c-0"> The sexual politics that
construct and maintain this distinction are effectively concealed by the
discursive production of a nature and, indeed, a natural sex that postures as the unquestioned foundation of culture. Critics of structuralism such as Clifford Geertz have argued that its universalizing
framework discounts the multiplicity of cultural configurations of
“nature.” The analysis that assumes nature to be singular and prediscursive cannot ask, what qualifies as “nature” within a given cultural context, and for what purposes? Is the dualism necessary at all? How are
the sex/gender and nature/culture dualisms constructed and naturalized in and through one another? What gender hierarchies do they
serve, and what relations of subordination do they reify? If the very
designation of sex is political, then “sex,” that designation supposed to
be most in the raw, proves to be always already “cooked,” and the central distinctions of structuralist anthropology appear to collapse.3
The effort to locate a sexed nature before the law seems to be
rooted understandably in the more fundamental project to be able to
think that the patriarchal law is not universally true and all-determining.
Indeed, if constructed gender is all there is, then there appears to be
~
no “outside,” no epistemic anchor in a precultural “before” that might
serve as an alternative epistemic point of departure for a critical
assessment of existing gender relations. Locating the mechanism
whereby sex is transformed into gender is meant to establish not only
the constructedness of gender, its unnatural and nonnecessary status,
but the cultural universality of oppression in nonbiologistic terms.
How is this mechanism formulated? Can it be found or merely imagined? Is the designation of its ostensible universality any less of a reification than the position that grounds universal oppression in biology?
Only when the mechanism of gender construction implies the contingency of that construction does “constructedness” per se prove useful
to the political project to enlarge the scope of possible gender configurations. If, however, it is a life of the body beyond the law or a recovery
of the body before the law which then emerges as the normative goal
of feminist theory, such a norm effectively takes the focus of feminist
theory away from the concrete terms of contemporary cultural struggle. Indeed, the following sections on psychoanalysis, structuralism,
and the status and power of their gender-instituting prohibitions centers precisely on this notion of the law:What is its ontological status—
is it juridical, oppressive, and reductive in its workings, or does it
inadvertently create the possibility of its own cultural displacement? To
what extent does the articulation of a body prior to articulation performatively contradict itself and spawn alternatives in its place?
i. Structuralism’s Critical Exchange
Structuralist discourse tends to refer to the Law in the singular, in
accord with Lévi-Strauss’s contention that there is a universal structure
of regulating exchange that characterizes all systems of kinship.
According to The Elementary Structures of Kinship, the </span><span class="c-3">object of exchange
that both consolidates and differentiates kinship relations is women,</span><span class="c-1">
given as gifts from one patrilineal clan to another through the institution of marriage.4 The bride, the gift, the object of exchange constitutes
“a sign and a value” that opens a channel of exchange that not only
~
serves the functional purpose of facilitating trade but </span><span class="c-3">performs the symbolic or ritualistic purpose of consolidating the internal bonds, the collective identity, of each clan differentiated through the act.</span><span class="c-1">5 In other
words, the bride functions as a relational term between groups of men;</span><span class="c-0">
she does not have an identity, and neither does she exchange one identity for another. She reflects masculine identity precisely through being
the site of its absence. Clan members, invariably male, invoke the prerogative of identity through marriage, a repeated act of symbolic differentiation. Exogamy distinguishes and binds patronymically specific
kinds of men. Patrilineality is secured through the ritualistic expulsion
of women and, reciprocally, the ritualistic importation of women. As
wives, women not only secure the reproduction of the name (the functional purpose), but effect a symbolic intercourse between clans of
men. As the site of a patronymic exchange, women are and are not the
patronymic sign, excluded from the signifier, the very patronym they
bear. The </span><span class="c-1">woman in marriage qualifies not as an identity, but only as a
relational term that both distinguishes and binds the various clans to a
common but internally differentiated patrilineal identity.</span><span class="c-0">
The structural systematicity of Lévi-Strauss’s explanation of kinship relations appeals to a universal logic that appears to structure
human relations. Although Lévi-Strauss reports in Tristes tropiques that
he left philosophy because anthropology provided a more concrete
cultural texture to the analysis of human life, he nevertheless assimilates that cultural texture to a totalizing logical structure that effectively returns his analyses to the decontextualized philosophical
structures he purported to leave. Although a number of questions can
be raised about the presumptions of universality in Lévi-Strauss’s work
(as they are in anthropologist Clifford Geertz’s Local Knowledge), the
questions here concern the place of identitarian assumptions in this
universal logic and the relationship of that identitarian logic to the subordinate status of women within the cultural reality that this logic
describes. If the symbolic nature of exchange is its universally human
character as well, and if that universal structure distributes “identity”
~
to male persons and a subordinate and relational “negation” or “lack” to
women, then this logic might well be contested by a position or set of
positions excluded from its very terms. What might an alternative
logic of kinship be like? To what extent do identitarian logical systems
always require the construction of socially impossible identities to
occupy an unnamed, excluded, but presuppositional relation subsequently concealed by the logic itself? Here the impe<a name="b-15"></a>tus for Irigaray’s
marking off of the phallogocentric economy becomes clear, as does a
major poststructuralist impulse within feminism that questions
whether an effective critique of phallogocentrism requires a displacement of the Symbolic as defined by Lévi-Strauss.
The </span><span class="c-2">totality and closure of language is both presumed and contested
within structuralism.</span><span class="c-0"> Although Saussure understands the relationship
of signifier and signified to be arbitrary, he places this arbitrary relation
within a necessarily complete linguistic system. All linguistic terms
presuppose a linguistic totality of structures, the entirety of which is
presupposed and implicitly recalled for any one term to bear meaning.
This quasi-Leibnizian view, in which language figures as a systematic
totality, effectively suppresses the moment of difference between signifier and signified, relating and unifying that moment of arbitrariness
within a totalizing field. The poststructuralist break with Saussure and
with the identitarian structures of exchange found in Lévi-Strauss
</span><span class="c-1">refutes the claims of totality and </span><span class="c-2">universality and the presumption of
binary structural oppositions that implicitly operate to quell the insistent ambiguity and openness of linguistic and cultural </span><span class="c-1">signification.</span><span class="c-0">6 As
a result, the discrepancy between signifier and signified becomes the
operative and limitless différance of language, rendering all referentiality into a potentially limitless displacement.
For Lévi-Strauss, the masculine cultural identity is established
through an overt act of differentiation between patrilineal clans, where
the “difference” in this relation is Hegelian—that is, one which simultaneously distinguishes and binds. But the “difference” established
between men and the women who effect the differentiation between
~
men eludes the dialectic altogether. In other words, the differentiating
moment of social exchange appears to be a social bond between men, a
Hegelian unity between masculine terms that are simultaneously specified and individualized.7 On an abstract level, this is an identityin-difference, since both clans retain a similar identity: male, patriarchal, and patrilineal. Bearing different names, they particularize themselves within this all-encompassing masculine cultural identity. But
what relation instates women as the object of exchange, clothed first
in one patronym and then another? What kind of differentiating
mechanism distributes gender functions in this way? What kind of differentiating différance is presupposed and excluded by the explicit,
male-mediating negation of Lévi-Strauss’s Hegelian economy? As
Irigaray argues, this phallogocentric economy depends essentially on
an economy of différance that is never manifest, but always both presupposed and disavowed. In effect, the relations among patrilineal
clans are based in homosocial desire (what Irigaray punningly calls
“hommo-sexuality”),8 a repressed and, hence, disparaged sexuality, a
relationship between men which is, finally, about the bonds of men,
but which takes place through the heterosexual exchange and distribution of women.9
In a passage that reveals the homoerotic unconscious of the phallogocentric economy, Lévi-Strauss offers the link between the incest
taboo and the consolidation of homoerotic bonds:
Exchange—and consequently the rule of exogamy—is not simply
that of goods exchanged. Exchange—and consequently the rule of
exogamy that expresses it—has in itself a social value. It provides the
means of binding men together.

The taboo generates exogamic heterosexuality which Lévi-Strauss
understands as the artificial accomplishment of a nonincestuous heterosexuality extracted through prohibition from a more natural and
unconstrained sexuality (an assumption shared by Freud in Three Essays
on the Theory of Sexuality).
~
The relation of reciprocity established between men, however, is
the condition of a relation of radical nonreciprocity between men
and women and a relation, as it were, of nonrelation between women.
Lévi-Strauss’s notorious claim that “the emergence of symbolic thought
must have required that women, like words, should be things that were
exchanged,” suggests a necessity that Lévi-Strauss himself induces from
the presumed universal structures of culture from the retrospective
position of a transparent observer. But the “must have” appears as an
inference only to function as a performative; since the moment in
which the symbolic emerged could not be one that Lévi-Strauss witnessed, he conjectures a necessary history: The report thereby
becomes an injunction. His analysis prompted Irigaray to reflect on
what would happen if “the goods got together” and revealed the unanticipated agency of an alternative sexual economy. Her recent work,
Sexes et parentés,10 offers a critical exegesis of how this construction of
reciprocal exchange between men presupposes a nonreciprocity
between the sexes inarticulable within that economy, as well as the
unnameability of the female, the feminine, and lesbian sexuality.
If there is a sexual domain that is excluded from the Symbolic and
can potentially expose the Symbolic as hegemonic rather than totalizing in its reach, it must then be possible to locate this excluded domain
either within or outside that economy and to strategize its intervention in terms of that placement. The following rereading of the structuralist law and the narrative that accounts for the production of sexual
difference within its terms centers on the presumed fixity and universality of that law and, through a genealogical critique, seeks to expose
that law’s powers of inadvertent and self-defeating generativity. Does
“the Law” produce these positions unilaterally or invariably? Can it
produce configurations of sexuality that effectively contest the law
itself, or are those contests inevitably phantasmatic? Can the generativity of that law be specified as variable or even subversive?
The law forbidding incest is the locus of this economy of kinship
that forbids endogamy. Lévi-Strauss maintains that the centrality of the
~
incest taboo establishes the significant nexus between structuralist
anthropology and psychoanalysis. Although Lévi-Strauss acknowledges
that Freud’s Totem and Taboo has been discredited on empirical grounds,
he considers that repudiating gesture as paradoxical evidence in support of Freud’s thesis. Incest, for Lévi-Strauss, is not a social fact, but a
pervasive cultural fantasy. Presuming the heterosexual masculinity of
the subject of desire, Lévi-Strauss maintains that “the desire for the
mother or the sister, the murder of the father and the sons’ repentance
undoubtedly do not correspond to any fact or group of facts occupying
a given place in history. But perhaps they symbolically express an
ancient and lasting dream.”11
In an effort to affirm the psychoanalytic insight into unconscious
incestuous fantasy, Lévi-Strauss refers to the “magic of this dream, its
power to mould men’s thoughts unbeknown to them . . . the acts it
evokes have never been committed, because culture opposes them at
all times and all places.”12 This rather astonishing statement provides
insight not only into Lévi-Strauss’s apparent powers of denial (acts of
incest “have never been committed” !), but the central difficulty with
assuming the efficacy of that prohibition.That the prohibition exists in
no way suggests that it works. Rather, its existence appears to suggest
that desires, actions, indeed, pervasive social practices of incest are
generated precisely in virtue of the eroticization of that taboo. That
incestuous desires are phantasmatic in no way implies that they are not
also “social facts.” The question is, rather, how do such phantasms
become generated and, indeed, instituted as a consequence of their
prohibition? Further, how does the social conviction, here symptomatically articulated through Lévi-Strauss, that the prohibition is efficacious disavow and, hence, clear a social space in which incestuous
practices are free to reproduce themselves without proscription?
For Lévi-Strauss, the taboo against the act of heterosexual incest
between son and mother as well as that incestuous fantasy are instated
as universal truths of culture. How is incestuous heterosexuality
constituted as the ostensibly natural and pre-artificial matrix for desire,
~
and how is desire established as a heterosexual male prerogative? The
</span><span class="c-1">naturalization of both heterosexuality and masculine sexual agency
are discursive constructions </span><span class="c-2">nowhere accounted for but everywhere
assumed </span><span class="c-1">within this founding structuralist frame.</span><span class="c-0">
The Lacanian appropriation of Lévi-Strauss focuses on the prohibition against incest and the rule of exogamy in the reproduction of
culture, where culture is understood primarily as a set of linguistic
structures and significations. For Lacan, the Law which forbids the
incestuous union between boy and mother initiates the structures of
kinship, a series of highly regulated libidinal displacements that take
place through language. Although the structures of language, collectively understood as the Symbolic, maintain an ontological integrity
apart from the various speaking agents through whom they work, the
Law reasserts and individuates itself within the terms of every infantile
entrance into culture. Speech emerges only upon the condition of dissatisfaction, where dissatisfaction is instituted through incestuous prohibition; the original jouissance is lost through the primary repression
that founds the subject. In its place emerges the sign which is similarly
barred from the signifier and which seeks in what it signifies a recovery
of that irrecoverable pleasure. Founded through that prohibition, the
subject speaks only to displace desire onto the metonymic substitutions for that irretrievable pleasure. Language is the residue and alternative accomplishment of dissatisfied desire, the variegated cultural
production of a sublimation that never really satisfies. That language
inevitably fails to signify is the necessary consequence of the prohibition which grounds the possibility of language and marks the vanity of
its referential gestures.
ii. Lacan, Riviere, and the Strategies of Masquerade
To ask after the “being” of gender and/or sex in Lacanian terms is to
confound the very purpose of Lacan’s theory of language. Lacan disputes the primacy given to ontology within the terms of Western
metaphysics and insists upon the subordination of the question
~
“What is/has being?” to the prior question “How is ‘being’ instituted
and allocated through the signifying practices of the paternal economy?” The ontological specification of being, negation, and their relations is understood to be determined by a language structured by the
paternal law and its mechanisms of differentiation. A thing takes on the
characterization of “being” and becomes mobilize<a name="b-16"></a>d by that ontological
gesture only within a structure of signification that, as the Symbolic, is
itself pre-ontological.
There is no inquiry, then, into ontology per se, no access to being,
without a prior inquiry into the “being” of the Phallus, the authorizing
signification of the Law that takes sexual difference as a presupposition
of its own intelligibility. “Being” the Phallus and “having” the Phallus
denote divergent sexual positions, or nonpositions (impossible positions, really), within language. To “be” the Phallus is to be the “signifier” of the </span><span class="c-1">desire of the Other and to appear as this signifier. In other
words, it is to be the object, the Other of a (heterosexualized) masculine desire, but also to represent or reflect that desire.This is an Other
that constitutes, not the limit of masculinity in a feminine alterity, but
the site of a masculine self-elaboration.</span><span class="c-0"> For </span><span class="c-2">women to “be” the Phallus
means, then, to reflect the power of the Phallus, to signify </span><span class="c-1">that power,
to “embody” the </span><span class="c-2">Phallus, to supply the site to which it penetrates, and
to </span><span class="c-3">signify the Phallus through “being” its Other, its absence, its lack, the
dialectical confirmation of its identity.</span><span class="c-2"> By claiming that the Other that
lacks the Phallus is the one who is the Phallus, Lacan clearly suggests
that power is wielded by this feminine position of not-having, that the
masculine subject </span><span class="c-1">who “has” the </span><span class="c-2">Phallus requires this Other to confirm
and, hence, be the Phallus in its “extended”</span><span class="c-1"> sense.</span><span class="c-0">13
This ontological characterization presupposes that the appearance
or effect of being is always produced through the structures of signification. The </span><span class="c-1">Symbolic order creates cultural intelligibility through the
mutually exclusive positions of “having” the Phallus (the position of
men) and “being” the Phallus (the paradoxical position of women).The
interdependency of these positions recalls the Hegelian structure of
~
failed reciprocity between master and slave, in particular, the unexpected dependency of the master on the slave in order to establish his
own identity through reflection.</span><span class="c-0">14 Lacan casts that drama, however, in
a phantasmatic domain. Every effort to establish identity within the
terms of this binary disjunction of “being” and “having” returns to the
inevitable “lack” and “loss” that ground their phantasmatic construction
and mark the incommensurability of the Symbolic and the real.
If the Symbolic is understood as a culturally universal structure of
signification that is nowhere fully instantiated in the real, it makes sense
to ask:What or who is it that signifies what or whom in this ostensibly
crosscultural affair? This question, however, is posed within a frame
that presupposes a subject as signifier and an object as signified, the traditional epistemological dichotomy within philosophy prior to the
structuralist displacement of the subject. Lacan calls into question this
scheme of signification. He poses the relation between the sexes in
terms that reveal the speaking “I” as a masculinized effect of repression,
one which postures as an autonomous and self-grounding subject, but
whose very coherence is called into question by the sexual positions
that it excludes in the process of identity formation. For Lacan, the
subject comes into being—that is, begins to posture as a self-grounding
signifier within language—only on the condition of a primary repression of the pre-individuated incestuous pleasures associated with the
(now repressed) maternal body.
The </span><span class="c-1">masculine subject only appears to </span><span class="c-3">originate meanings and
thereby to signify.</span><span class="c-2"> His seemingly self-grounded autonomy attempts
to conceal the repression which is both its ground and the perpetual
possibility of its own ungrounding.</span><span class="c-0"> But that </span><span class="c-1">process of meaningconstitution </span><span class="c-2">requires that women reflect that masculine power and
everywhere reassure that power of the reality of its illusory autonomy.</span><span class="c-0">
This task is confounded, to say the least, when the demand that women
reflect the autonomous power of masculine subject/signifier becomes
essential to the construction of that autonomy and, thus, becomes the
basis of a radical dependency that effectively undercuts the function it
~
serves. But further, this dependency, although denied, is also pursued by
the masculine subject, for the woman as reassuring sign is the displaced
maternal body, the vain but persistent promise of the recovery of preindividuated jouissance. The conflict of masculinity appears, then, to be
precisely the demand for a full recognition of autonomy that will also
and nevertheless promise a return to those full pleasures prior to
repression and individuation.
</span><span class="c-1">Women are said to “be” the Phallus in the sense that they maintain
the power to reflect or represent the “reality” of the self-grounding
postures of the masculine subject,</span><span class="c-0"> a power which, if withdrawn, would
break up the foundational illusions of the masculine subject position.
In order to “be” the Phallus, the reflector and guarantor of an apparent
masculine subject position, women must become, must “be” (in the
sense of “posture as if they were”) precisely what men are not and, in
their very lack, establish the essential function of men. Hence, “being”
the Phallus is always a “being for” a </span><span class="c-1">masculine subject who seeks to
reconfirm and augment his identity through the recognition </span><span class="c-0">of that
“being for.” In a strong sense, Lacan disputes the notion that men signify
the </span><span class="c-1">meaning of women or that women signify the meaning of men. The
division and exchange between this “being” and “having” the Phallus is
established by the Symbolic, the paternal law. Part of the comedic
dimension of this failed model of reciprocity, of course, is that both
</span><span class="c-2">masculine and feminine positions are signified, the signifier belonging
to the Symbolic that can never be assumed in more than token form by
either position.</span><span class="c-0">
To be the Phallus is to be signified by the paternal law, to be both its
object and its instrument and, in structuralist terms, the “sign” and
promise of its power. Hence, as the constituted or signified object of
exchange through which the paternal law extends its power and the
mode in which it appears, women are said to be the Phallus, that is, the
emblem of its continuing circulation. But this “being” the Phallus is
necessarily dissatisfying to the extent that women can never fully
reflect that law; some feminists argue that it requires a renunciation of
~
women’s own desire (a double renunciation, in fact, corresponding to
the “double wave” of repression that Freud claimed founds femininity),15 which is the expropriation of that desire as the desire to be
nothing other than a reflection, a guarantor of the pervasive necessity
of the Phallus.
On the other hand, men are said to “have” the Phallus, yet never to
“be” it, in the sense that the penis is not equivalent to that Law and
can never fully symbolize that Law. Hence, there is a necessary or presuppositional impossibility to any effort to occupy the position of “having” the Phallus, with the consequence that both positions of “having”
and “being” are, in Lacan’s terms, finally to be understood as comedic
failures that are nevertheless compelled to articulate and enact these
repeated impossibilities.
But how does a woman “appear” to be the Phallus, the lack that
embodies and affirms the Phallus? According to Lacan, this is done
through masquerade, the effect of a melancholy that is essential to the
feminine position as such. In his early essay, “The Meaning of the
Phallus,” he writes of “the </span><span class="c-1">relations between the sexes”:
</span><span class="c-2">Let us say that these relations will revolve </span><span class="c-1">around a being and a
having which, because they refer to a signifier, the phallus, have the
contradictory effect of on the one hand lending reality to the subject
in that signifier, and on the other making unreal the relations to be
signified.</span><span class="c-0">16

In the lines that directly follow this sentence, Lacan appears to
refer to the appearance of the “reality” of the masculine subject as well
as to the “unreality” of heterosexuality. He also appears to refer to the
position of women (my interruption is within brackets): “This follows
from the intervention of an ‘appearing’ which gets substituted for the
‘having’ [a substitution is required, no doubt, because women are said
not “to have”] so as to protect it on one side and to mask its lack on
the other.” Although there is no grammatical gender here, it seems
that Lacan is describing the position of women for whom “lack” is
~
characteristic and, hence, in need of masking and who are in some
unspecified sense in need of protection. Lacan then states that this situation produces “the effect that the ideal or typical manifestations of
behaviour in both sexes, up to and including the act of sexual copulation, are entirely propelled into comedy” (84).
Lacan continues this exposition of heterosexual comedy by explaining that this “appearing as being” the Phallus that women are compelled to do is inevitably masquerade. The term is significant because it
suggests contradictory meanings: On the one hand, if the “being,” the
ontological specification of the Phallus, is masquerade, then it would
appear to reduce all being to a form of appearing, the appearance of
being, with the consequence that all gender ontology is reducible to
the play of appearances. On the other hand, masquerade </span><span class="c-2">suggests that
there is a “being” or ontological specification of femininity prior to the
masquerade, a feminine desire or demand that is masked and capable
of disclosure,</span><span class="c-0"> that, indeed, might promise an eventual disruption and
displacement of the phallogocentric signifying economy.
At least two very different tasks can be discerned from the
ambiguous structure of Lacan’s analysis. On the one </span><span class="c-2">hand, masquerade
may be understood as the performative production of a sexual ontology, an appearing that makes itself convincing as a “being”; on the other
hand, masquerade can be read as a </span><span class="c-3">denial of a feminine desire </span><span class="c-1">that presupposes some prior ontological femininity regularly unrepresented
by the phallic economy.</span><span class="c-0"> </span><span class="c-2">Irigaray remarks in such a vein that “the masquerade . . . is what women do . . . in order to participate in man’s
desire, but at the cost </span><span class="c-0">of giving up their own.”17 The former task </span><span class="c-1">would
engage a critical reflection on gender ontology as parodic (de)construction and, perhaps, pursue the mobile possibilities of the slippery
distinction between “appearing” and “being,” a radicalization of the
“comedic” dimension of sexual ontology only partially pursued by
Lacan.</span><span class="c-0"> The latter would initiate </span><span class="c-1">feminist strategies of unmasking in
order to recover or release whatever feminine desire has remained
suppressed within the terms of the phallic economy.</span><span class="c-0">18
~
Perhaps these alternative directions are not as mutually exclusive
as they appear, since appearances become more suspect all the time.
Reflections on the meaning of masquerade in Lacan as well as in Joan
Rivie<a name="b-17"></a>re’s “Womanliness as a Masquerade” have differed greatly in their
interpretations of what precisely is masked by masquerade. Is masquerade the consequence of a feminine desire that must be negated
and, thus, made into a lack that, nevertheless, must appear in some
way? Is masquerade the consequence of a denial of this lack for the purpose of appearing to be the Phallus? Does masquerade construct femininity as the reflection of the Phallus in order to disguise bisexual
possibilities that otherwise might disrupt the seamless construction of
a heterosexualized femininity? Does masquerade, as Riviere suggests,
transform aggression and the fear of reprisal into seduction and flirtation? Does it </span><span class="c-1">serve primarily to conceal or repress a pregiven femininity, a feminine desire which would establish an insubordinate alterity
to the masculine subject and expose the necessary failure of masculinity? Or is masquerade the means by which femininity itself is first </span><span class="c-0">established, the exclusionary practice of identity formation in which the
masculine is effectively excluded and instated as outside the boundaries of a feminine gendered position?
Lacan continues the quotation cited above:
Paradoxical as this formulation might seem, it is in order to be the
phallus, that is, the </span><span class="c-2">signifier of the desire of the Other, that the woman
will reject an essential part of her femininity,</span><span class="c-1"> notably all its attributes
through masquerade. It is for what she is not that she expects to be
desired as well as loved. But she finds the signifier of her own desire in
the body of the one to whom she addresses her demand for love.
Certainly we should not forget that the organ invested with this signifying function takes on the value of a fetish.</span><span class="c-0"> (84)

If this unnamed “organ,” presumably the penis (treated like the Hebraic
Yahweh, never to be spoken), is a fetish, why should it be that we might
so easily forget it, as Lacan himself assumes? And what is the “essential
~
part of her femininity” that must be rejected? Is it the, again, unnamed
part which, once rejected, appears as a lack? Or is it the lack itself that
must be rejected, so that she might appear as the Phallus itself? Is the
unnameability of this “essential part” the same unnameability that
attends the male “organ” that we are always in danger of forgetting? Is
this precisely that forgetfulness that constitutes the repression at the
core of feminine masquerade? Is it a presumed masculinity that must
be forfeited in order to appear as the lack that confirms and, therefore,
is the Phallus, or is it a phallic possibility, that must be negated in order
to be that lack that confirms?
Lacan clarifies his own position as he remarks that “the function of
the mask . . . dominates the identifications through which refusals of
love are resolved” (85). In other words, the mask is part of the incorporative strategy of melancholy, the taking on of attributes of the
object/Other that is lost, where loss is the consequence of a refusal of
love.19 That the mask “dominates” as well as “resolves” these refusals
suggests that appropriation is the strategy through which those refusals
are themselves refused, a double negation that redoubles the structure
of identity through the melancholic absorption of the one who is, in
effect, twice lost.
Significantly, Lacan locates the discussion of the mask in conjunction with an account of female homosexuality. He claims that “the orientation of feminine homosexuality, as observation shows, follows from
a disappointment which reenforces the side of the demand for love”
(85). Who is observing and what is being observed are conveniently
elided here, but Lacan takes his commentary to be obvious to anyone
who cares to look.What one sees through “observation” is the founding
disappointment of the female homosexual, where this disappointment
recalls the refusals that are dominated/resolved through masquerade.
One also “observes” somehow that the female homosexual is subject to
a strengthened idealization, a demand for love that is pursued at the
expense of desire.
Lacan continues this paragraph on “feminine homosexuality” with
~
the statement partially quoted above: “These remarks should be qualified by going back to the function of the mask [which is] to dominate
the identifications through which refusals of love are resolved,” and if
female homosexuality is understood as a consequence of a disappointment “as observation shows,” then this disappointment must appear,
and appear clearly, in order to be observed. If Lacan presumes that
female homosexuality issues from a disappointed heterosexuality, as
observation is said to show, could it not be equally clear to the observer that heterosexuality issues from a disappointed homosexuality? Is it
the mask of the female homosexual that is “observed,” and if so, what
clearly readable expression gives evidence of that “disappointment”
and that “orientation” as well as the displacement of desire by the (idealized) demand for love? Lacan is perhaps suggesting that what is clear
to observation is the desexualized status of the lesbian, the incorporation of a refusal that appears as the absence of desire.20 But we can
understand this conclusion to be the necessary result of a heterosexualized and masculine observational point of view that takes lesbian sexuality to be a refusal of sexuality per se only because sexuality is
presumed to be heterosexual, and the observer, here constructed as
the heterosexual male, is clearly being refused. Indeed, is this account
not the consequence of a refusal that disappoints the observer, and
whose disappointment, disavowed and projected, is made into the
essential character of the women who effectively refuse him?
In a characteristic gliding over pronomial locations, Lacan fails to
make clear who refuses whom. As readers, we are meant, however, to
understand that this free-floating “refusal” is linked in a significant way
to the </span><span class="c-1">mask. If every refusal is, finally, a loyalty to some other bond in
the present or the past, refusal is simultaneously preservation as well.
The mask thus conceals this loss, but preserves (and negates) this
loss through its concealment. The mask has a double function which
is the double function of melancholy. The mask is taken on through
the process of incorporation which is a way of inscribing and then
wearing a melancholic identification in and on the body; in effect, it is
~
the signification of the body in the mold of the Other </span><span class="c-0">who has been
refused. Dominated through appropriation, every refusal fails, and the
refuser becomes part of the very identity of the refused, indeed,
becomes the psychic refuse of the refused. The </span><span class="c-1">loss of the object is
never absolute because it is redistributed within a psychic/corporeal
boundary that expands to incorporate that loss.</span><span class="c-0"> This locates the
process of gender incorporation within the wider orbit of melancholy.
Published in 1929, Joan Riviere’s essay, “Womanliness as a Masquerade,”21 introduces the notion of femininity as masquerade in terms
of a theory of aggression and conflict resolution.This theory appears at
first to be far afield from Lacan’s analysis of masquerade in terms of the
comedy of sexual positions. She begins with a respectful review of
Ernest Jones’s typology of the development of female sexuality into
heterosexual and homosexual forms. She focuses, however, on the
“intermediate types” that blur the boundaries between the heterosexual
and the homosexual and, implicitly, contest the descriptive capacity of
Jones’s classificatory system. In a remark that resonates with Lacan’s
facile reference to “observation,” Riviere seeks recourse to mundane
perception or experience to validate her focus on these “intermediate
types”: “In daily life types of men and women are constantly met with
who, while mainly heterosexual in their development, plainly display
strong features of the other sex” (35). What is here most plain is the
classifications that condition and structure the perception of this mix of
attributes. Clearly, Riviere begins with set notions about what it is to
display characteristics of one’s sex, and how it is that those plain characteristics are understood to express or reflect an ostensible sexual orientation.22 This perception or observation not only assumes a correlation
among characteristics, desires, and “orientations,”23 but creates that
unity through the perceptual act itself. Riviere’s postulated unity
between gender attributes and a naturalized “orientation” appears as an
instance of what Wittig refers to as the “imaginary formation” of sex.
And yet, Riviere calls into question these naturalized typologies
through an appeal to a psychoanalytic account that locates the meaning
~
of mixed gender attributes in the “interplay of conflicts” (35). Significantly, she contrasts this kind of psychoanalytic theory with one that
would reduce the presence of ostensibly “masculine” attributes in a
woman to a “radical or fundamental tendency.” In other words, the
acquisition of such attributes and the accomplishment of a heterosexual
or homosexual orientation are produced through the resolution of conflicts that have as their aim the suppression of anxiety. Citing Ferenczi in
order to establish an analogy with her own account, Riviere writes:
Ferenczi pointed out . . . that homosexual men exaggerate their
heterosexuality as a ‘defence’ against their homosexuality. I shall
attempt to show that </span><span class="c-4">women who </span><span class="c-5">wish for masculinity may put on a
mask of womanliness to avert anxiety and the retribution feared
from men.</span><span class="c-0"> (35)

It is unclear what is the “exaggerated” form of heterosexuality the
homosexual man is alleged to display, but the phenomenon under
notice here might simply be that gay men simply may not look much
different from their heterosexual counterparts. This lack of an overt
differentiating style or appearance may be diagnosed as a symptomatic
“defense” only because the gay man in question does not conform to
the idea of the homosexual that the analyst has drawn and sustained
from cultural stereotypes. A Lacanian analysis might argue that the
supposed “exaggeration” in the homosexual man of whatever attributes
count as apparent heterosexuality is the attempt to “have” the Phallus,
the subject position that entails an active and heterosexualized desire.
Similarly, the “mask” of the “women who wish for masculinity” can be
interpreted as an effort to renounce the “having” of the </span><span class="c-1">Phallus in order
to avert retribution by those from whom it must have been procured
through castration.</span><span class="c-0"> Riviere explains the fear of retribution as the consequence of a woman’s fantasy to take the place of men, more precisely, of the father. In the case that she herself examines, which some
consider to be autobiographical, the rivalry with the father is not over
~
the desire of the mother, as one might expect, but over the </span><span class="c-1">pla<a name="b-18"></a>ce of the
father in public discourse as speaker, lecturer, writer—that is, as a user
of signs rather than a sign-object, an item of exchange.</span><span class="c-0"> This castrating
desire might be understood as the desire to relinquish the status of
woman-as-sign in order to appear as a subject within language.
Indeed, the analogy that Riviere draws between the homosexual
man and the masked woman is not, in her view, an analogy between
male and female homosexuality. Femininity is taken on by a woman
who “wishes for masculinity,” but fears the retributive consequences of
taking on the public appearance of masculinity. Masculinity is taken on
by the male homosexual who, presumably, seeks to hide—not from
others, but from himself—an ostensible femininity. The </span><span class="c-1">woman takes
on a masquerade knowingly in order to conceal her masculinity from
the masculine audience she wants to castrate.</span><span class="c-0"> But the homosexual man
is said to exaggerate his “heterosexuality” (meaning a masculinity that
allows him to pass as heterosexual?) as a “defense,” unknowingly,
because he cannot acknowledge his own homosexuality (or is it that
the analyst would not acknowledge it, if it were his?). In other words,
the homosexual man takes unconscious retribution on himself, both
desiring and fearing the consequences of castration. The male homosexual does not “know” his homosexuality, although Ferenczi and
Riviere apparently do.
But does Riviere know the homosexuality of the woman in masquerade that she describes? When it comes to the counterpart of the
analogy that she herself sets up, the woman who “wishes for masculinity” is homosexual only in terms of sustaining a masculine identification,
but not in terms of a sexual orientation or desire. Invoking Jones’s
typology once again, as if it were a phallic shield, she formulates a
“defense” that designates as asexual a class of female homosexuals understood as the masquerading type: “his first group of homosexual women
who, while taking no interest in other women, wish for ‘recognition’ of
their masculinity from men and claim to be the equals of men, or in
other words, to be men themselves” (37). As in Lacan, the lesbian is
~
here signified as an asexual position, as indeed, a position that refuses
sexuality. For the earlier analogy with Ferenzci to become complete, it
would seem that this description enacts the “defense” against female
homosexuality as sexuality that is nevertheless understood as the reflexive structure of the “homosexual man.” And yet, there is no clear way to
read this description of a female homosexuality that is not about a sexual desire for women. Riviere would have us believe that this curious
typological anomaly cannot be reduced to a repressed female homosexuality or heterosexuality.What is hidden is not sexuality, but rage.
One possible interpretation is that the woman in masquerade
wishes for masculinity in order to engage in public discourse with men
and as a man as part of a male homoerotic exchange. And precisely
because that male homoerotic exchange would signify castration, she
fears the same retribution that motivates the “defenses” of the homosexual man. Indeed, perhaps femininity as masquerade is meant to
deflect from male homosexuality—that being the erotic presupposition of hegemonic discourse, the “hommo-sexuality” that Irigaray suggests. In any case, Riviere would have us consider that such women
sustain masculine identifications not to occupy a position in a sexual
exchange, but, rather, to pursue a rivalry that has no sexual object or,
at least, that has none that she will name.
Riviere’s text offers a way to reconsider the question: What is
masked by masquerade? In a key passage that marks a departure from
the restricted analysis demarcated by Jones’s classificatory system, she
suggests that “masquerade” is more than the characteristic of an “intermediate type,” that it is central to all “womanliness”:
The </span><span class="c-10">reader may now ask how I define womanliness or where I draw
the line between genuine womanliness and the ‘masquerade’. My
suggestion is not, however, that there is any such difference; whether
radical or superficial, they are the same thing.</span><span class="c-0"> (38)

This refusal to postulate a femininity that is prior to mimicry and
the mask is taken up by Stephen Heath in “Joan Riviere and the
~
Masquerade” as evidence for the notion that “authentic womanliness is
such a mimicry, is the masquerade.” Relying on the postulated characterization of libido as masculine, Heath concludes that femininity is the
denial of that libido, the “dissimulation of a fundamental masculinity.”24
</span><span class="c-1">Femininity </span><span class="c-2">becomes a mask that dominates/resolves a masculine
identification, for a masculine identification would, within the presumed heterosexual matrix of desire, produce a desire for a female
object, the Phallus; hence, the donning of </span><span class="c-3">femininity as mask may
reveal a refusal of a female homosexuality and, at the same time, the
hyperbolic incorporation of that female Other who is refused—</span><span class="c-2">an odd
form of preserving and protecting that love within the circle of the
melancholic and negative narcissism that results from the psychic
inculcation of compulsory heterosexuality.</span><span class="c-0">
One might read Riviere as fearful of her own phallicism25—that is,
of the phallic identity she risks exposing in the course of her lecture,
her writing, indeed, the writing of this phallicism that the essay itself
both conceals and enacts. It may, however, be less her own masculine
identity than the masculine heterosexual desire that is its signature that
she seeks both to deny and enact by becoming the object she forbids
herself to love. </span><span class="c-1">This is the predicament produced by a matrix that
accounts for all desire for women by subjects of whatever sex or gender as originating in a masculine, heterosexual position. The libidoas-masculine is the source from which all possible sexuality is presumed to come.</span><span class="c-0">26
Here the typology of gender and sexuality needs to give way to a
discursive account of the cultural production of gender. If Riviere’s
analysand is a homosexual without homosexuality, that may be because
that option is already refused her; the cultural existence of this prohibition is there in the lecture space, determining and differentiating her
as speaker and her mainly male audience. Although she fears that her
castrating wish might be understood, she denies that there is a contest
over a common object of desire without which the masculine identification that she does acknowledge would lack its confirmation and
~
essential sign. Indeed, her account presupposes the primacy of aggression over sexuality, the desire to castrate and take the place of the masculine subject, a desire avowedly rooted in a rivalry, but one which, for
her, exhausts itself in the act of displacement. But the question might
usefully be asked: What sexual fantasy does this aggression serve, and
what sexuality does it authorize? Although the right to occupy the
position of a language user is the ostensible purpose of the analysand’s
aggression, we can ask whether there is not a repudiation of the feminine that prepares this position within speech and which, invariably,
reemerges as the Phallic-Other that will phantasmatically confirm the
authority of the speaking subject?
We might then rethink the very notions of masculinity and femininity constructed here as rooted in unresolved homosexual cathexes.
The melancholy refusal/domination of homosexuality culminates in
the incorporation of the same-sexed object of desire and reemerges in
the construction of discrete sexual “natures” that require and institute
their opposites through exclusion. To presume the primacy of bisexuality or the primary characterization of the libido as masculine is still
not to account for the construction of these various “primacies.” Some
psychoanalytic accounts would argue that femininity is based in the
exclusion of the masculine, where the masculine is one “part” of a
bisexual psychic composition. The coexistence of the binary is
assumed, and then repression and exclusion intercede to craft discretely gendered “identities” out of this binary, with the result that
identity is always already inherent in a bisexual disposition that is,
through repression, severed into its component parts. In a </span><span class="c-1">sense, the
binary restriction on culture postures as the precultural bisexuality
that sunders into heterosexual familiarity through its advent into “culture.” From the </span><span class="c-2">start, however, the binary restriction on sexuality
shows clearly that culture in no way postdates the bisexuality that it
purports to repress: It constitutes the matrix of intelligibility through
which primary bisexuality itself becomes thinkable.</span><span class="c-1"> The “bisexuality”
that is posited as a psychic foundation and is said to be repressed at a
~
later date is a discursive production that claims to be prior to all discourse, effected through the compulsory and generative </span><span class="c-0">exclusionary
practices of normative heterosexuality.
Lacanian discourse centers on the notion of “a divide,” a primary
or fundamental </span><span class="c-1">split that renders the subject internally divided and
that establishes the duality of the sexes. But why this exclusive focus on
the fall into twoness? Within Lacanian terms, it appears that division is
always the effect of the law, and not a preexisting condition on which
the law acts.</span><span class="c-0"> Jacqueline Rose writes that “for both sexes, sexuality will
necessarily touch on the duplicity which undermines its fundamental
divide,”27 suggesting that sexual division, effected through repression,
is invariably undermined by the very ruse of identity. But is it not a
prediscursive doubleness that comes to undermine the univocal posturing of each position within the field of sexual difference? Rose
writes compellingly that “for Lacan, as we have seen, there is no prediscursive reality (‘How return, other than by means of a special discourse, to a prediscursive reality?’, SXX, p. 33), no place prior to the
law which is available and can be retrieved.” As an indirect critique of
Irigaray’s efforts to mark a place for feminine writing outside the phallic economy, Rose then adds, “And there is no feminine outside language.”28 If prohibition creates the “fundamental divide” of sexuality,
and if this “divide” is shown to be duplicitous precisely because of the
artificiality of its division, then there must be a division that resists division, a psychic doubleness or inherent bisexuality that comes to undermine every effort of severing. To consider this psychic doubleness as
the effect of the Law is Lacan’s stated purpose, but the point of resistance within his theory as well.
Rose is no doubt right to claim that every identification, precisely
because it has a phantasm as its ideal, is bound to fail.Any psychoanalytic theory that prescribes a developmental process that presupposes the
accomplishment of a given father-son or mother-daughter identification mi<a name="b-19"></a>stakenly conflates the Symbolic with the real and misses the critical point of incommensurability that exposes “identification” and the
~
drama of “being” and “having” the Phallus as invariably phantasmatic.29
And yet, what determines the domain of the phantasmatic, the rules
that regulate the incommensurability of the Symbolic with the real? It is
</span><span class="c-1">clearly not enough to claim that this drama holds for Western, late capitalist household dwellers and that perhaps in some yet to be defined
epoch some other Symbolic regime will govern the language of sexual
ontology. By instituting the Symbolic as invariably phantasmatic, the
“invariably” wanders into an “inevitably,” generating a description of
sexuality in terms that promote cultural stasis as its result.</span><span class="c-0">
The rendition of Lacan that understands the prediscursive as an
impossibility promises a critique that conceptualizes the Law as prohibitive and generative at once.That the language of physiology or disposition does not appear here is welcome news, but binary
restrictions nevertheless still operate to frame and formulate sexuality
and delimit in advance the forms of its resistance to the “real.” In
marking off the very domain of what is subject to repression, exclusion operates prior to repression—that is, in the delimitation of the
Law and its objects of subordination. </span><span class="c-1">Although one can argue that for
Lacan repression creates the repressed through the prohibitive and
paternal law, that argument does not account for the pervasive nostalgia for the lost fullness of jouissance in his work. Indeed, the loss could
not be understood as loss unless the very irrecoverability of that pleasure did not designate a past that is barred from the present through
the prohibitive </span><span class="c-0">law. That we cannot know that past from the position
of the founded subject is not to say that that past does not reemerge
within that subject’s speech as fêlure, discontinuity, metonymic slippage. As the truer noumenal reality existed for Kant, the prejuridical
past of jouissance is unknowable from within spoken language; that
does not mean, however, that this past has no reality.The very inaccessibility of the past, indicated by metonymic slippage in contemporary
speech, confirms that original fullness as the ultimate reality.
The further question emerges:What </span><span class="c-1">plausibility can be given to an
</span><span class="c-2">account of the Symbolic that requires a conformity to the Law that
~
proves impossible to perform and that makes no room for the flexibility
of the Law itself, its cultural reformulation in more plastic forms?</span><span class="c-1"> The
injunction to become sexed in the ways prescribed by the Symbolic
always leads to failure and, in some cases, to the exposure of the phantasmatic nature of sexual identity itself.The Symbolic’s claim to be cultural intelligibility in its present and hegemonic form effectively
consolidates the power of those phantasms as well as the various dramas
of identificatory failures. The alternative is not to suggest that identification should become a viable accomplishment. But </span><span class="c-2">there does seem to
be a </span><span class="c-3">romanticization or, indeed, a religious idealization of “failure,”
humility and limitation before the Law, which makes the Lacanian narrative </span><span class="c-2">ideologically suspect.</span><span class="c-0">The </span><span class="c-1">dialectic between a juridical imperative
that cannot be fulfilled and an inevitable failure “before the law” recalls
the </span><span class="c-2">tortured relationship between the God of the Old Testament and
those humiliated servants who offer their obedience without reward.</span><span class="c-0">
That sexuality now embodies this religious impulse in the form of the
demand for love (considered to be an “absolute” demand) that is distinct
from both need and desire (a kind of ecstatic transcendence that
eclipses sexuality altogether) lends further credibility to the Symbolic
as that which operates for human subjects as the inaccessible but alldetermining deity.
This </span><span class="c-2">structure of religious tragedy in Lacanian theory effectively
</span><span class="c-3">undermines any strategy of cultural politics to configure an alternative
imaginary for the play of desires.</span><span class="c-0"> If the Symbolic guarantees the failure
of the tasks it commands, perhaps its purposes, like those of the Old
Testament God, are altogether unteleological—not the accomplishment of some goal, but obedience and suffering to enforce the “subject’s” sense of limitation “before the law.” There is, of course, the
comic side to this drama that is revealed through the disclosure of the
permanent impossibility of the realization of identity. But even this
comedy is the inverse expression of an enslavement to the God that it
claims to be unable to overcome.
Lacanian theory must be understood as a kind of “slave morality.”
~
How would Lacanian theory be reformulated after the appropriation
of Nietzsche’s insight in On the Genealogy of Morals that God, the inaccessible Symbolic, is rendered inaccessible by a power (the will-to-power)
that regularly institutes its own powerlessness?30 This figuration of the
paternal law as the inevitable and unknowable authority before which
the sexed subject is bound to fail must be read for the theological
impulse that motivates it as well as for the critique of theology that
points beyond it.The construction of the law that guarantees failure is
symptomatic of a slave morality that </span><span class="c-1">disavows the very generative
powers it uses to construct the “Law” as a permanent impossibility.</span><span class="c-0">
What is the power that creates this fiction that reflects inevitable subjection? What are the cultural stakes in keeping power within that selfnegating circle, and how might that power be reclaimed from the
trappings of a prohibitive law that is that power in its dissimulation and
self-subjection?
iii. Freud and the Melancholia of Gender
Although Irigaray maintains that the structure of femininity and melancholy “cross-check”31 and Kristeva identifies motherhood with melancholy in “Motherhood According to Bellini” as well as Soleil noir:
Dépression et mélancolie,32 </span><span class="c-2">there has been little effort to understand the
melancholic denial/preservation of homosexuality in the production of
gender within the heterosexual frame.</span><span class="c-0"> Freud isolates the mechanism of
melancholia as essential to “ego formation” and “character,” but only
alludes to the centrality of melancholia to gender. In The Ego and the Id
(1923), he elaborates on the structure of mourning as the incipient
structure of ego formation, a thesis whose traces can be found in the
1917 essay “Mourning and Melancholia.”33 In the experience of losing
another human being whom one has loved, Freud argues, the ego is said
to incorporate that other into the very structure of the ego, taking on
attributes of the other and “sustaining” the other through magical acts of
imitation.The </span><span class="c-2">loss of the other whom one desires and loves is overcome
through a specific act of identification that seeks to harbor that other
~
within </span><span class="c-0">the very structure of the self: “So by taking flight into the ego,
love escapes annihilation” (178). This identification is not simply
momentary or occasional, but becomes a new structure of identity; in
effect, the </span><span class="c-1">other becomes part of the ego through the permanent internalization of the other’s attributes.34 In cases in which an ambivalent
relationship is severed through loss, that ambivalence becomes internalized as a self-critical or self-debasing disposition in which the role of the
other is now occupied and directed by the ego itself: “The </span><span class="c-8">narcissistic
identification with the </span><span class="c-10">object then becomes a substitute for the erotic
cathexis, the result of which is that in spite of the conflict with the loved
person the love-relation need not be given </span><span class="c-0">up” (170). Later, Freud
makes clear that the process of internalizing and sustaining lost loves is
crucial to the formation of the ego and its “object-choice.”
In The Ego and the Id, Freud refers to this process of internalization
described in “Mourning and Melancholia” and remarks:
we </span><span class="c-1">succeeded in explaining the painful disorder of melancholia by
supposing that [in those suffering from it] an object which was lost
has been set up again inside the ego—that is, that an object-cathexis
has been replaced by an identification. At that time,</span><span class="c-0"> however, we did
not appreciate the full significance of this process and did not </span><span class="c-1">know
how common and how typical it is. Since then we have come to
understand that this kind of substitution has a </span><span class="c-2">great share in determining the form taken by the </span><span class="c-3">ego </span><span class="c-2">and that it makes an essential contribution towards building up what is called </span><span class="c-1">its “character.</span><span class="c-0">” (18)

As this chapter on “The Ego and the Super-Ego (Ego-Ideal)” proceeds,
however, it is not merely “character” that is being described, but the
acquisition of gender identity as well. In claiming that “it </span><span class="c-2">may be that
this identification is the sole condition under which the id can give up
its objects,</span><span class="c-0">” Freud suggests that the internalizing strategy of melancholia does not oppose the work of mourning, but may be the only way in
~
tate of abandoned object-cathexes and that it contains the history of
those object-choices” (19). This process of internalizing lost loves
becomes pertinent to gender formation when we realize that the
incest taboo, among other functions, initiates a loss of a love-object for
the ego and that this ego recuperates from this loss through the internalization of the tabooed object of desire. In the case of a prohibited
heterosexual union, it is the object which is denied, but not the modality of desire, so that the desire is deflected from that object onto other
objects of the opposite sex. But in the case of a prohibited homosexual
union, it is clear that both the desire and the object require renunciation and so become subject to the internalizing strategies of melancholia. Hence, “the young boy deals with his father by identifying himself
with him” (21).
In the first formation of the boy-father identification, Freud speculates that the identification takes place without the prior object
cathexis (21), meaning that the identification is not the consequence of
a love lost or prohibited of the son for the father. Later, however, Freud
does postulate primary bisexuality as a complicating factor in the
process of character and gender formation. With the postulation of a
bisexual set of libidinal dispositions, there is no reason to deny an original sexual love of the son for the father, and yet Freud implicitly does.
The boy does, however, sustain a primary cathexis for the mother, and
Freud remarks that bisexuality there makes itself known in the masculine and feminine behavior with which the boy-child attempts to
seduce the mother.
Although Freud introduces the Oedipal complex to explain why
the boy must repudiate the mother and adopt an ambivalent attitude
toward the father, he remarks shortly afterward that, “It </span><span class="c-1">may even be
that the ambivalence displayed in the relations to the parents should be
attributed entirely to bisexuality and that it is not, as I <a name="b-20"></a>have represented
above, developed out of identification in consequence of rivalry”</span><span class="c-0"> (23,
n.1). But what would condition the ambivalence in such a case? Clearly,
Freud means to suggest that the boy must choose not only between the
~
two object choices, but the two sexual dispositions, masculine and feminine.That the boy usually chooses the </span><span class="c-1">heterosexual </span><span class="c-2">would, then, be the
result, not of the fear of castration by the father, but of the fear of castration—</span><span class="c-1">that is, the fear of “feminization” associated within heterosexual cultures with male homosexuality. In effect, it is not </span><span class="c-3">primarily the
heterosexual lust for the mother that must be punished and sublimated,
but the </span><span class="c-4">homosexual cathexis that must be subordinated to a culturally
sanctioned heterosexuality.</span><span class="c-0"> Indeed, if it is primary bisexuality rather
than the Oedipal drama of rivalry which produces the boy’s repudiation
of femininity and his ambivalence toward his father, then the primacy of
the maternal cathexis becomes increasingly suspect and, consequently,
the primary heterosexuality of the boy’s object cathexis.
Regardless of the reason for the boy’s repudiation of the mother
(do we construe the punishing father as a rival or as an object of desire
who forbids himself as such?), the repudiation becomes the founding
moment of what Freud calls gender “consolidation.” Forfeiting the
mother as object of desire, the boy either internalizes the loss through
identification with her, or displaces his heterosexual attachment, in
which case he fortifies his attachment to his father and thereby “consolidates” his masculinity. As the metaphor of consolidation suggests, </span><span class="c-1">there
are clearly bits and pieces of masculinity to be found within the psychic
landscape, dispositions, sexual trends, and aims, but they are diffuse and
disorganized, unbounded by the exclusivity of a heterosexual object
choice. Indeed, if the boy renounces both aim and object and, therefore, heterosexual cathexis altogether, he internalizes the mother and
sets </span><span class="c-0">up a feminine superego which dissolves and disorganizes masculinity, consolidating feminine libidinal dispositions in its place.
For the young girl as well, the Oedipal complex can be either “positive” (same-sex identification) or “negative” (opposite-sex identification); the loss of the father initiated by the incest taboo may result
either in an identification with the object lost (a consolidation of masculinity) or a deflection of the aim from the object, in which case heterosexuality triumphs over homosexuality, and a substitute object is
~
found.At the close of his brief paragraph on the negative Oedipal complex in the young girl, Freud remarks that the factor that decides
which identification is accomplished is the strength or weakness of
masculinity and femininity in her disposition. Significantly, Freud
avows his confusion about what precisely a masculine or feminine disposition is when he interrupts his statement midway with the hyphenated doubt: “—whatever that may consist in—” (22).
What are these primary dispositions on which Freud himself apparently founders? Are these attributes of an unconscious libidinal organization, and how precisely do the various identifications set up in
consequence of the Oedipal conflict work to reinforce or dissolve each
of these dispositions? What aspect of “femininity” do we call dispositional, and which is the consequence of identification? Indeed, what is to
keep us from understanding the “dispositions” of bisexuality as the effects
or productions of a series of internalizations? Moreover, how do we identify a “feminine” or a “masculine” disposition at the outset? By what
traces is it known, and to what extent do we assume a “feminine” or a
“masculine” disposition as the precondition of a heterosexual object
choice? In other words, to what extent do we read the desire for the
father as evidence of a feminine disposition only because we begin,
despite the postulation of primary bisexuality, with a heterosexual
matrix for desire?
The </span><span class="c-1">conceptualization of bisexuality in terms of dispositions, feminine
and masculine, which have heterosexual aims as their intentional correlates, suggests that for Freud </span><span class="c-2">bisexuality is the </span><span class="c-3">coincidence of two heterosexual desires within a single psyche.</span><span class="c-1"> The masculine disposition </span><span class="c-0">is, in effect,
never oriented toward the father as an object of sexual love, and neither
is the feminine disposition oriented toward the mother (the young girl
may be so oriented, but this is before she has renounced that “masculine” side of her dispositional nature). In repudiating the mother as an
object of sexual love, the girl of necessity repudiates her masculinity
and, paradoxically, “fixes” her femininity as a consequence. Hence,
~
within Freud’s thesis of primary bisexuality, there is no homosexuality,
and only opposites attract.
But what is the proof Freud gives us for the existence of such
dispositions? If there is no way to distinguish between the femininity
acquired through internalizations and that which is strictly dispositional,
then what is to preclude the conclusion that all gender-specific affinities
are the consequence of internalizations? On what basis are dispositional
sexualities and identities ascribed to individuals, and what meaning can
we give to “femininity” and “masculinity” at the outset? Taking the problematic of internalization as a point of departure, let us consider the status of internalized identifications in the formation of gender and,
secondarily, the relation between an internalized gender affinity and the
self-punishing melancholia of internalized identifications.
In “Mourning and Melancholia,” Freud interprets the self-critical
attitudes of the melancholic to be the result of the internalization of a
lost object of love. Precisely because that object is lost, even though
the relationship remains ambivalent and unresolved, the object is
“brought inside” the ego where the quarrel magically resumes as an
interior dialogue between two parts of the psyche. In “Mourning and
Melancholia,” the lost object is set up within the ego as a critical voice
or agency, and the anger originally felt for the object is reversed so that
the internalized object now berates the ego:
If one listens patiently to the many and various self-accusations of the
melancholic, one cannot in the end avoid the impression that often
the most violent of them are hardly applicable to the patient himself,
but that with insignificant modifications they do fit someone else,
some person whom the patient loves, has loved or ought to love. . . .
the self-reproaches are reproaches against a loved object which have
been shifted onto the patient’s own ego. (169)

The </span><span class="c-1">melancholic refuses the loss of the object, and internalization
becomes a strategy of magically resuscitating the lost object, not only

~
because the loss is painful, but because the ambivalence felt toward the
object requires that the object be retained until differences are settled.</span><span class="c-0">
In this early essay, Freud understands grief to be the withdrawal of
libidinal cathexis from the object and the successful transferral of that
cathexis onto a fresh object. In The Ego and the Id, however, Freud revises this distinction between mourning and melancholia and suggests that
the identification process associated with melancholia may be “the sole
condition under which the id can give up its objects” (19). In other
words, the identification with lost loves characteristic of melancholia
becomes the precondition for the work of mourning.The two processes, originally conceived as oppositional, are now understood as integrally related aspects of the grieving process.35 In his later view, Freud
remarks that the internalization of loss is compensatory: “When the ego
assumes the features of the object, it is forcing itself, so to speak, upon
the id’s loss by saying: ‘Look, you can love me too—I am so like the
object’ ”(20). Strictly speaking, the giving up of the object is not a negation of the cathexis, but its internalization and, hence, preservation.
What precisely is the topology of the psyche in which the ego and
its lost loves reside in perpetual habitation? Clearly, Freud conceptualizes the ego in the perpetual company of the ego ideal which acts as a
moral agency of various kinds. The internalized losses of the ego are
reestablished as part of this agency of moral scrutiny, the internalization of anger and blame originally felt for the object in its external
mode. In the act of internalization, that anger and blame, inevitably
heightened by the loss itself, are turned inward and sustained; the ego
changes place with the internalized object, thereby investing this internalized externality with moral agency and power.Thus, the ego forfeits
its anger and efficacy to the ego ideal which turns against the very ego
by which it is sustained; in other words, the ego constructs a way to
turn against itself. Indeed, Freud warns of the hypermoral possibilities
of this ego ideal, which, taken to its extreme, can motivate suicide.36
The construction of the interior ego ideal involves the internali-

~
zation of gender identities as well. Freud remarks that the ego ideal is
a solution to the Oedipal complex and is thus instrumental in the
successful consolidation of masculinity and femininity:
The super-ego is, however, not simply a residue of the earliest
object-choices of the id: it also represents an energetic reaction-formation against these choices. Its relation to the ego is not exhausted
by the precept: “You ought to be like this (like your father.)” It also
comprises the prohibition: “You may not be like this (like your
father)—that is, you may not do all that he does; some things are his
prerogative.” (24)

The ego ideal thus serves as an interior agency of sanction and
taboo which, according to Freud, works to consolidate gender identity
through the appropriate rechanneling and sublimation of desire. The
internalization of the parent as object of love suffers a necessary inversion of meaning.The parent is not only prohibited as an object of love,
but is internalized as a prohibiting or withholding object of love. The
prohibitive function of the ego ideal thus works to inhibit or, indeed,
repress the expression of desire for that parent, but also founds an
interior “space” in which that love can be preserved. Because the solution
to the Oedipal dilemma can be either “positive” or “negative,” the prohibition of the opposite-sexed parent can either lead to an identification with the sex of the parent lost or a refusal of that identification
and, consequently, a deflection of heterosexual </span><span class="c-1">desire.
As a </span><span class="c-3">set of sanctions and taboos, the ego ideal regulates and determines masculine and feminine identification. </span><span class="c-4">Because identifications
substitute for object relations, and identifications are the consequence
of loss, </span><span class="c-6">gender identification is <a name="b-21"></a>a </span><span class="c-7">kind of melancholia in which the sex
of the prohibited object is internalized as a prohibition.</span><span class="c-5"> This prohibition sanctions and regulates </span><span class="c-4">discrete gendered identity and the law </span><span class="c-3">of
heterosexual </span><span class="c-4">desire.</span><span class="c-1"> The </span><span class="c-3">resolution of the Oedipal complex affects
gender identification through not only the incest taboo, but, prior to
that, the taboo against homosexuality. The result is that one identifies
~
with the same-sexed object of love, thereby internalizing both the aim
and object of the homosexual cathexis. The identifications consequent
to melancholia are modes of preserving unresolved object relations,
and in the case of same-sexed gender identification, the unresolved
object relations are invariably homosexual.</span><span class="c-2"> Indeed, the stricter and
more stable the gender affinity, the less resolved the original loss, so
that rigid gender boundaries inevitably work to conceal the loss of an
original love that, unacknowledged, fails to be resolved.</span><span class="c-0">
But clearly not all gender identification is based on the successful
implementation of the taboo against homosexuality. If feminine and
masculine dispositions are the result of the effective internalization of
that taboo, and if the melancholic answer to the loss of the same-sexed
object is to incorporate and, indeed, to become that object through the
construction of the ego ideal, then gender identity appears primarily
to be the internalization of a prohibition that proves to be formative of
identity. Further, this identity is constructed and maintained by the
consistent application of this taboo, not only in the stylization of the
body in compliance with discrete categories of sex, but in the production and “disposition” of sexual desire. The language of disposition
moves from a verb formation (to be disposed) into a noun formation,
whereupon it becomes congealed (to have dispositions); the language of
“dispositions” thus arrives as a false foundationalism, the results of
affectivity being formed or “fixed” through the effects of the prohibition. As a consequence, dispositions are not the primary sexual facts of
the psyche, but produced effects of a law imposed by culture and by
the complicitous and transvaluating acts of the ego ideal.
In melancholia, the loved object is lost through a variety of means:
separation, death, or the breaking of an emotional tie. In the Oedipal
situation, however, the loss is dictated by a prohibition attended by a set
of punishments. The melancholia of gender identification which
“answers” the Oedipal dilemma </span><span class="c-1">must be understood, then, as the internalization of an interior moral directive which gains its structure and
energy from an externally enforced taboo.</span><span class="c-0"> Although Freud does not
~
explicitly argue in its favor, it </span><span class="c-1">would appear that the </span><span class="c-2">taboo against
homosexuality </span><span class="c-3">must precede the heterosexual incest taboo;</span><span class="c-2"> the taboo
against homosexuality in effect creates the heterosexual “dispositions”
by which the Oedipal conflict becomes </span><span class="c-1">possible.</span><span class="c-0"> The young boy and
young girl who enter into the Oedipal drama with incestuous heterosexual aims have already been subjected to prohibitions which “dispose” them in distinct sexual directions. </span><span class="c-1">Hence, the dispositions that
Freud assumes to be primary or constitutive facts of sexual life are
effects of a law which, internalized, produces and regulates discrete
gender identity and heterosexuality.</span><span class="c-0">
Far from foundational, these dispositions are the result of a process
whose aim is to disguise its own genealogy. In other words, “dispositions” are traces of a history of enforced sexual prohibitions which is
untold and which the prohibitions seek to render untellable. The narrative account of gender acquisition that begins with the postulation of
dispositions effectively forecloses the narrative point of departure
which would expose the narrative as a self-amplifying tactic of the prohibition itself. In the psychoanalytic narrative, the dispositions are
trained, fixed, and consolidated by a prohibition which later and in the
name of culture arrives to quell the disturbance created by an unrestrained homosexual cathexis.Told from the point of view which takes
the prohibitive law to be the founding moment of the narrative, the
law both produces sexuality in the form of “dispositions” and </span><span class="c-1">appears
disingenuously at a later point in time to transform these ostensibly
“natural” dispositions into culturally acceptable structures of exogamic
kinship.</span><span class="c-0"> In order to </span><span class="c-1">conceal the genealogy of the law as productive of
the very phenomenon it later claims only to channel or repress,</span><span class="c-0"> the
law performs a third function: Instating itself as the principle of logical
continuity in a narrative of causal relations which takes psychic facts as
its point of departure, this configuration of the law forecloses the possibility of a more radical genealogy into the cultural origins of sexuality and power relations.
What precisely does it mean to reverse Freud’s causal narrative and
~
to think of primary dispositions as effects of the law? In the first volume
of The History of Sexuality, Foucault criticizes the repressive hypothesis
for the presumption of an original desire (not “desire” in Lacan’s terms,
but jouissance) that maintains ontological integrity and temporal priority with respect to the repressive law.37 This law, according to Foucault,
subsequently silences or transmutes that desire into a secondary and
inevitably dissatisfying form or expression (displacement). Foucault
argues that the </span><span class="c-2">desire which is conceived as both original and repressed
is the effect of the subjugating law itself. In consequence, the law produces the conceit of the repressed desire in order to rationalize its own
self-amplifying strategies, and, rather than exercise a repressive function, the juridical law, here as elsewhere, ought to be reconceived as a
discursive practice which is productive or generative—discursive in
that it produces the linguistic fiction of repressed desire in order to
maintain its own position as a teleological instrument.</span><span class="c-0"> The desire in
question takes on the meaning of “repressed” to the extent that the law
constitutes its contextualizing frame; indeed, the law identifies and
invigorates “repressed desire” as such, circulates the term, and, in
effect, carves out the discursive space for the self-conscious and linguistically elaborated experience called “repressed desire.”
The taboo against incest and, implicitly, against homosexuality is a
repressive injunction which presumes an original desire localized in
the notion of “dispositions,” which suffers a repression of an originally
homosexual libidinal directionality and produces the displaced phenomenon of heterosexual desire.The structure of this particular metanarrative of infantile development figures sexual dispositions as the
prediscursive, temporally primary, and ontologically discrete drives
which have a purpose and, hence, a meaning prior to their emergence
into language and culture. The very entry into the cultural field
deflects that desire from its original meaning, with the consequence
that desire within culture is, of necessity, a series of displacements.
Thus, the repressive law effectively produces heterosexuality, and acts
not merely as a negative or exclusionary code, but as a sanction and,
~
most pertinently, as a law of discourse, distinguishing the speakable
from the unspeakable (delimiting and constructing the domain of the
unspeakable), the legitimate from the illegitimate.
iv. Gender Complexity and the Limits
of Identification
The foregoing analyses of Lacan, Riviere, and Freud’s The Ego and the Id
offer competing versions of how gender identifications work—indeed,
of whether they can be said to “work” at all. Can gender complexity
and dissonance be accounted for by the multiplication and convergence of a variety of culturally dissonant identifications? Or is all identification constructed through the exclusion of a sexuality that puts
those identifications into question? In the first instance, multiple identifications can constitute a nonhierarchical configuration of shifting
and overlapping identifications that call into question the primacy of
any univocal gender attribution. In the Lacanian framework, identification is understood to be fixed within the binary disjunction of “having”
or “being” the Phallus, with the consequence that the excluded term of
the binary continually haunts and disrupts the coherent posturing of
any one. The excluded term is an excluded sexuality that contests the
self-grounding pretensions of the subject as well as its claims to know
the source and object of its desire.
For the most part, feminist critics concerned with the psychoanalytic problematic of identification have often focused on the question
of a maternal identification and sought to </span><span class="c-1">elaborate a feminist epistemological position from that maternal identification and/or a maternal discourse evolved from the point of view of that identification </span><span class="c-0">and
its difficulties. Although much of that work is extremely significant and
clearly influential, it has come to occupy a hegemonic position within
the emerging canon of feminist theory. Further, it </span><span class="c-1">tends to </span><span class="c-2">reinforce
precisely the binary, heterosexist framework that carves up genders
into masculine and feminine </span><span class="c-1">and forecloses an adequate description of
the kinds of subversive and parodic convergences that characterize gay
~
and lesbian cultures.</span><span class="c-0"> As a very partial effort to come to terms with that
maternalist discourse, however, Julia Kristeva’s description of the
semiotic as a maternal subversion of the Symbolic will be examined in
the following chapter.
What critical strategies and sources of subversion appear as the
consequence of the psychoanalytic accounts considered so far? The
recourse to the unconscious as a source of subversion makes sense, it
seems, only if the paternal law is understood as a rigid and universal
determinism which makes of “identity” a fixed and phantasmatic affair.
Even if we accept the phantasmatic content of identity, there is no reason to assume that the law which fixes the terms of that fantasy is
impervious to historical variability and possibility.
As opposed to the founding Law of the Symbolic that fixes identity
in advance, we might reconsider the history of constitutive identifications without the presupposition of a fixed and founding Law. Although
the “universality” of the paternal law may be contested within anthropological circles, it seems important to consider that the meaning that the
law sustains in any given historical context is less univocal and less
deterministically efficacious than the Lacanian account appears to
acknowledge. It should be possible to offer a schematic of the ways in
which a constellation of identifications conforms or fails to conform to
culturally imposed standards of gender integrity.The </span><span class="c-1">constitutive identifications of an autobiographical narrative are al<a name="b-22"></a>ways partially fabricated in the telling. Lacan claims that we can never tell the story of our
origins, precisely because language bars the speaking subject from the
repressed libidinal origins of its speech; however, the foundational
moment in which the paternal law institutes the subject seems to function as a metahistory which we not only can but ought to tell, even
though the founding moments of the subject, the institution of the law,
is as equally prior to the speaking subject as the unconscious </span><span class="c-0">itself.
The alternative perspective on identification that emerges from
psychoanalytic theory suggests that </span><span class="c-1">multiple and coexisting identifications produce conflicts, convergences, and innovative dissonances
~
within gender configurations which contest the fixity of masculine and
feminine placements with respect to the paternal law.</span><span class="c-0"> In effect, the
possibility of multiple identifications (which are not finally reducible
to primary or founding identifications that are fixed within masculine
and feminine positions) suggests that the Law is not deterministic and
that “the” law may not even be singular.
The debate over the meaning or subversive possibilities of identifications so far has left unclear exactly where those identifications are to
be found.The </span><span class="c-1">interior psychic space in which identifications are said to
be preserved makes sense only if we can understand that interior space
as a phantasized locale that serves yet another psychic function.</span><span class="c-0"> In
agreement with Nicolas Abraham and Maria Torok it seems, psychoanalyst Roy Schafer argues that “incorporation” is a fantasy and not a
process; the interior space into which an object is taken is imagined,
and imagined within a language that can conjure and reify such
spaces.38 If the identifications sustained through melancholy are
“incorporated,” then the question remains: Where is this incorporated
space? If it is not literally within the body, perhaps it is on the body as
its surface signification such that the body must itself be understood as
an incorporated space.
Abraham and Torok have argued that introjection is a process that
serves the work of mourning (where the object is not only lost, but
acknowledged as lost).39 Incorporation, on the other hand, belongs
more properly to melancholy, the state of disavowed or suspended
grief in which the object is magically sustained “in the body” in some
way. Abraham and Torok suggest that introjection of the loss characteristic of mourning </span><span class="c-2">establishes an empty space, literalized by the empty
mouth which becomes the condition of speech and signification.</span><span class="c-0"> The
successful displacement of the libido from the lost object is achieved
through the formation of words which both signify and displace that
object; this displacement from the original object is an essentially
metaphorical activity in which words “figure” the absence and surpass
~
poration, which denotes a magical resolution of loss, characterizes
melancholy.</span><span class="c-1">Whereas introjection founds the possibility of metaphorical signification, </span><span class="c-2">incorporation is antimetaphorical precisely because it
maintains the loss as radically unnameable;</span><span class="c-1"> in other words, incorporation is not only a failure to name or avow the loss, but erodes the conditions of metaphorical </span><span class="c-0">signification itself.
As in the Lacanian perspective, for Abraham and Torok the repudiation of the maternal body is the condition of signification within the
Symbolic. They argue further that this primary repression founds the
possibility of individuation and of significant speech, where speech is
necessarily metaphorical, in the sense that the referent, the object of
desire, is a perpetual displacement. In effect, the loss of the maternal
body as an object of love is understood to establish the empty space out
of which words originate. But the refusal of this </span><span class="c-1">loss—melancholy—
results in the failure to displace into words; indeed, the place of the
maternal body is established in the body, “encrypted,” to use their term,
and given permanent residence there as a dead and deadening part of
the body or one inhabited or possessed by phantasms of various kinds.</span><span class="c-0">
When we consider gender identity as a melancholic structure, it
makes sense to choose “incorporation” as the manner by which that
identification is accomplished. Indeed, according to the scheme above,
gender identity would be established through a </span><span class="c-1">refusal of loss that
encrypts itself in the body and that determines, in effect, the living
versus the dead body.</span><span class="c-0"> As an antimetaphorical activity, incorporation
literalizes the loss on or in the body and so appears as the facticity of the
body, the means by which the body comes to bear “sex” as its literal
truth. The localization and/or prohibition of pleasures and desires in
given “erotogenic” zones is precisely the kind of gender-differentiating
melancholy that suffuses the body’s surface.The loss of the pleasurable
object is resolved through the incorporation of that very pleasure with
the result that pleasure is both determined and prohibited through the
compulsory effects of the gender-differentiating law.
The incest taboo is, of course, more inclusive than the taboo against
~
homosexuality, but in the case of the heterosexual incest taboo through
which heterosexual identity is established, the loss is borne as grief. In
the case of the prohibition against homosexual incest through which
heterosexual identity is established, however, the loss is sustained
through a melancholic structure. The loss of the heterosexual object,
argues Freud, results in the displacement of that object, but not the heterosexual aim; on the other hand, the loss of the homosexual object
requires the loss of the aim and the object. In other words, the </span><span class="c-2">object is
not only lost, but the desire fully denied, such that “I never lost that person and I never loved that person, indeed never felt that kind of love at
all.” The melancholic preservation of that love is all the more securely
safeguarded </span><span class="c-0">through the totalizing trajectory of the denial.
Irigaray’s argument that in Freud’s work the structures of melancholy and of developed femininity are very similar refers to the
denial of both object and aim that constitutes the “double wave” of
repression characteristic of a fully developed femininity. For Irigaray, it
is the recognition of castration that initiates the young girl into “a
‘loss’ that radically escapes any representation.”40 Melancholia is thus a
psychoanalytic norm for women, one that rests upon her ostensible
desire to have the penis, a desire which, conveniently, can no longer be
felt or known.
Irigaray’s reading, full of mocking citations, is right to debunk the
developmental claims regarding sexuality and femininity that clearly
pervade Freud’s text. As she also shows, there are possible readings of
that theory that exceed, invert, and displace Freud’s stated aims.
Consider that the refusal of the homosexual cathexis, desire and aim
together, a refusal both compelled by social taboo and appropriated
through developmental stages, results in a melancholic structure
which effectively encloses that aim and object within the corporeal
space or “crypt” established through an abiding denial. If the heterosexual denial of homosexuality results in melancholia and if melancholia
operates through incorporation, then the disavowed homosexual love
~
der identity. In other words, </span><span class="c-1">disavowed male homosexuality culminates in a heightened or consolidated masculinity, one which maintains
the feminine as the unthinkable and unnameable.</span><span class="c-0">The acknowledgment
of heterosexual desire, however, leads to a displacement from an original to a secondary object, precisely the kind of libidinal detachment
and reattachment that Freud affirms as the character of normal grief.
Clearly, a homosexual for whom heterosexual desire is unthinkable
may well maintain that heterosexuality through a melancholic structure
of incorporation, an identification and embodiment of the love that is
neither acknowledged nor grieved. But here it becomes clear that the
heterosexual refusal to acknowledge the primary homosexual attachment is culturally enforced by a prohibition on homosexuality which is
in no way paralleled in the case of the melancholic homosexual. In
other words, heterosexual melancholy is culturally instituted and maintained as the price of stable gender identities related through oppositional desires.
But what language of surface and depth adequately expresses this
incorporating effect of melancholy? A preliminary answer to this question is possible within the psychoanalytic discourse, but a fuller understanding will lead in the last chapter to a consideration of </span><span class="c-2">gender as an
enactment that performatively constitutes the appearance of its own
interior fixity.</span><span class="c-0"> At this point, however, the contention that incorporation
is a fantasy suggests that the incorporation of an identification is a fantasy of literalization or a literalizing fantasy.41 Precisely by virtue of its
melancholic structure, this literalization of the body conceals its genealogy and offers itself under the category of “natural fact.”
What does it mean to sustain a literalizing fantasy? If gender differentiation follows upon the incest taboo and the prior taboo on homosexuality, then “becoming” a gender is a laborious process of becoming
naturalized, which requires a differentiation of bodily pleasures and
parts on the basis of gendered meanings. Pleasures are said to reside in
the penis, the vagina, and the breasts or to emanate from them, but such
descriptions </span><span class="c-1">correspond to a body which has already been constructed
~
or naturalized as gender-specific.</span><span class="c-0"> In other words, some parts of the
body become conceivable foci of pleasure precisely because they correspond to a normative ideal of a gender-specific body. Pleasures are in
some sense determined by the melancholic structure of gender whereby some organs are deadened to pleasure, and others brought to life.
Which pleasures shall live and which shall die is often a matter of which
serve the legitimating practices of identity formation that take place
within the matrix of gender norms.42
</span><span class="c-2">Transsexuals </span><span class="c-3">often claim a radical discontinuity between sexual
pleasures and bodily parts.</span><span class="c-2">Very often what is wanted in terms of pleasure requires an imaginary participation in body parts, either appendages or orifices, that one might not actually possess, or, similarly,
pleasure may require imagining an exaggerated or diminished set of
parts.The imaginary status of desire, of course, is not restricted to the
transsexual identity; the phantasmatic nature of desire reveals the body
not as its ground or cause, but as its occasion and its object. The </span><span class="c-3">strategy
of desire is in part the transfiguration of the desiring body </span><span class="c-1">itself.
Indeed, in order to desire at all it may be necessary to believe in an
altered bodily ego43 which, within the gendered rules of the imaginar<a name="b-23"></a>y,
might fit the requirements of a body capable of desire.</span><span class="c-0"> This imaginary
condition of desire always exceeds the physical body through or on
which it works.
Always already a cultural sign, the body sets limits to the imaginary meanings that it occasions, but is never free of an imaginary construction. The fantasized body can never be understood in relation to
the body as real; it can only be understood in relation to another culturally instituted fantasy, one which claims the place of the “literal” and
the “real.” The limits to the “real” are produced within the naturalized
heterosexualization of bodies in which physical facts serve as causes
and desires reflect the inexorable effects of that physicality.
The conflation of desire with the real—that is, the belief that it is
parts of the body, the “literal” penis, the “literal” vagina, which cause
~
acteristic of the syndrome of melancholic heterosexuality. The disavowed </span><span class="c-1">homosexuality at the base of melancholic heterosexuality
reemerges as the self-evident anatomical facticity of sex, where “sex”
designates the blurred unity of anatomy, “natural identity,” and “natural
</span><span class="c-0">desire.” The loss is denied and incorporated, and the genealogy of that
transmutation fully forgotten and repressed. The sexed surface of the
body thus emerges as the necessary sign of a natural(ized) identity and
desire. The loss of homosexuality is refused and the love sustained or
encrypted in the parts of the body itself, literalized in the ostensible
anatomical facticity of sex. Here we see the general strategy of literalization as a form of forgetfulness, which, in the case of a literalized
sexual anatomy, “forgets” the imaginary and, with it, an imaginable
homosexuality. In the case of the melancholic heterosexual male, he
never loved another man, he is a man, and he can seek recourse to the
empirical facts that will prove it. But the literalization of anatomy not
only proves nothing, but is a literalizing restriction of pleasure in the
very organ that is championed as the sign of masculine identity. The
love for the father is stored in the penis, safeguarded through an
impervious denial, and the desire which now centers on that penis has
that continual denial as its structure and its task. Indeed, the womanas-object must be the sign that he not only never felt homosexual
desire, but never felt the grief over its loss. Indeed, the woman-as-sign
must effectively displace and conceal that preheterosexual history in
favor of one that consecrates a seamless heterosexuality.
v. Reformulating Prohibition as Power
Although Foucault’s genealogical critique of foundationalism has
guided this reading of Lévi-Strauss, Freud, and the heterosexual
matrix, an even more precise understanding is needed of how the
juridical law of psychoanalysis, repression, produces and proliferates
the genders it seeks to control. Feminist theorists have been drawn to
the psychoanalytic account of sexual difference in part because the
Oedipal and pre-Oedipal dynamics appear to offer a way to trace the
~
primary construction of gender. Can the </span><span class="c-1">prohibition against incest that
proscribes and sanctions hierarchial and binary gendered positions be
reconceived as a productive power that inadvertently generates several
cultural configurations of gender?</span><span class="c-0"> Is the incest taboo subject to the critique of the repressive hypothesis that Foucault provides? What would
a feminist deployment of that critique look like? Would such a critique
mobilize the project to confound the binary restrictions on sex/gender imposed by the heterosexual matrix? Clearly, one of the most
influential feminist readings of Lévi-Strauss, Lacan, and Freud is </span><span class="c-6">Gayle
Rubin’s “The Traffic of Women: The ‘Political Economy’ of Sex,</span><span class="c-0">” published in 1975.44 Although Foucault does not appear in that article,
Rubin effectively sets the stage for a Foucaultian critique.That she herself later appropriates Foucault for her own work in radical sexual theory45 retrospectively raises the question of how that influential article
might be rewritten within a Foucaultian frame.
Foucault’s analysis of the culturally productive possibilities of the
prohibitive law clearly takes its bearing within the existing theory on
sublimation articulated by Freud in Civilization and its Discontents and
reinterpreted by Marcuse in Eros and Civilization. Both Freud and
Marcuse identify the productive effects of sublimation, arguing that cultural artifacts and institutions are the effects of sublimated Eros.
Although Freud saw the sublimation of sexuality as producing a general
“discontent,” Marcuse subordinates Eros to Logos in Platonic fashion
and saw in the act of sublimation the most satisfying expression of the
human spirit. In a radical departure from these theories of sublimation,
however, Foucault argues on behalf of a productive law without the postulation of an original desire; the operation of this law is justified and
consolidated through the construction of a narrative account of its own
genealogy which effectively masks its own immersion in power relations. The incest taboo, then, would repress no primary dispositions,
but effectively create the distinction between “primary” and “secondary”
dispositions to describe and reproduce the distinction between a legitimate heterosexuality and an illegitimate homosexuality. Indeed, if we
~
conceive of the incest taboo as primarily productive in its effects, then
the prohibition that founds the “subject” and survives as the law of its
desire becomes the means by which identity, particularly gender identity, is constituted.
Underscoring the incest taboo as both a prohibition and a sanction, Rubin writes:
the incest taboo imposes the social aim of exogamy and alliance upon
the biological events of sex and procreation.The </span><span class="c-1">incest taboo divides
the universe of sexual choice into categories of permitted and prohibited sexual partners.</span><span class="c-0"> (173)

</span><span class="c-2">Because all cultures seek to reproduce themselves, and because the
particular social identity of the kinship group must be preserved,
exogamy is instituted </span><span class="c-0">and, as its presupposition, so is exogamic heterosexuality. Hence, the incest taboo not only forbids </span><span class="c-2">sexual union
between members of the same kinship line, but involves a taboo
against homosexuality as well.</span><span class="c-0"> Rubin writes:
the </span><span class="c-1">incest taboo presupposes a prior, less articulate taboo on homosexuality. A prohibition against some heterosexual unions assumes a
taboo against nonheterosexual unions. Gender is not only an identification with one sex; it also entails that sexual desire be directed
toward the other sex.</span><span class="c-0"> The </span><span class="c-1">sexual division of labor is implicated in
both aspects of gender—male and female it creates them, and it creates them heterosexual.</span><span class="c-0"> (180)

Rubin understands psychoanalysis, especially in its Lacanian incarnation, to complement Lévi-Strauss’s description of kinship relations.
In particular, she understands that the “sex/gender system,” the regulated cultural mechanism of transforming biological males and females
into discrete and hierarchized genders, is at once mandated by cultural
institutions (the family, the residual forms of “the exchange of
women,” obligatory heterosexuality) and inculcated through the laws
which structure and propel individual psychic development. Hence,
~
the Oedipal complex instantiates and executes the cultural taboo
against incest and results in discrete gender identification and a corollary heterosexual disposition. In this essay, Rubin further maintains
that before the transformation of a biological male or female into a
gendered man or woman, “each child contains all of the sexual possibilities available to human expression” (189).
The effort to locate and describe a sexuality “before the law” as a
primary bisexuality or as an ideal and unconstrained polymorphousness implies that the law is antecedent to sexuality. As a restriction of
an originary fullness, the law prohibits some set of prepunitive sexual
possibilities and the sanctioning of others. But if we apply the
Foucaultian critique of the repressive hypothesis to the incest taboo,
that paradigmatic law of repression, then it would appear that the law
</span><span class="c-1">produces both sanctioned heterosexuality and transgressive homosexuality. Both are indeed effects, temporally and ontologically later than
the law itself, and the illusion of a sexuality before the law is itself the
creation of that law.</span><span class="c-0">
Rubin’s essay </span><span class="c-1">remains committed to a distinction between sex and
gender which assumes the discrete and prior ontological reality of a
“sex” which is done over in the name of the law,</span><span class="c-0"> that is, transformed
subsequently into “gender.”This narrative of gender acquisition requires
a certain temporal ordering of events which assumes that the narrator is
in some position to “know” both what is before and after the law. And
yet the narration takes place within a language which, strictly speaking,
is after the law, the consequence of the law, and so proceeds from a
belated and retrospective point of view. If this language is structured by
the law, and the law is exemplified, indeed, enacted in the language,
then the description, the narration, not only cannot know what is outside itself—that is, prior to the law—but its description of that “before”
will always be in the service of the “after.” In other words, not only does
the narration claim access to a “before” from which it is definitionally
(by virtue of its linguisticality) precluded, but the description of the

~
“before” takes place within the terms of the “after” and, hence, becomes
an attenuation of the law itself into the site of its absence.
Although Rubin claims that the unlimited universe of sexual possibilities exists for the pre-Oedipal child, she does not subscribe to a
primary bisexuality. Indeed, bisexuality is the consequence of childrearing practices in which parents of both sexes are present and
presently occupied with child care and in which the repudiation of
femininity no longer serves as a precondition of gender identity for
both men and women (199).When Rubin calls for a “revolution in kinship,” she envisions the eradication of the exchange of women, the
traces of which are evident not only in the contemporary institutionalization of heterosexuality, but in the residual psychic norms (the institutionalization of the psyche) which sanction and construct sexuality
and gender identity in heterosexual terms. With the loosening of the
compulsory character of heterosexuality and the simultaneous emergence of bisexual and homosexual cultural possibilities for behavior
and identity, Rubin envisions the overthrow of gender itself (204).
Inasmuch as gender is the cultural transformation of a biological polysexuality into a culturally mandated heterosexuality and inasmuch as
that heterosexuality deploys discrete and hierarchized gender identities
to accomplish its aim, then the breakdown of the comp<a name="b-24"></a>ulsory character
of heterosexuality would imply, for Rubin, the corollary breakdown of
gender itself. Whether or not gender can be fully eradicated and in
what sense its “breakdown” is culturally imaginable remain intriguing
but unclarified implications of her analysis.
Rubin’s argument rests on the possibility that the law can be effectively overthrown and that the cultural interpretation of differently
sexed bodies can proceed, ideally, without reference to gender disparity. That systems of compulsory heterosexuality may alter, and indeed
have changed, and that the exchange of women, in whatever residual
form, need not always determine heterosexual exchange, seems clear;
in this sense, Rubin recognizes the misogynist implications of Lévi-

~
Strauss’s notoriously nondiachronic structuralism. But what leads
her to the conclusion that gender is merely a function of compulsory
heterosexuality and that without that compulsory status, the field of
bodies would no longer be marked in gendered terms? Clearly, Rubin
has already envisioned an alternative sexual world, one which is attributed to a utopian stage in infantile development, a “before” the law
which promises to reemerge “after” the demise or dispersal of that law.
If we accept the Foucaultian and Derridean criticisms of the viability of
knowing or referring to such a “before,” how would we revise this narrative of gender acquisition? If we reject the postulation of an ideal
sexuality prior to the incest taboo, and if we also refuse to accept the
structuralist premise of the cultural permanence of that taboo, what
relation between sexuality and the law remains for the description of
gender? Do we need recourse to a happier state before the law in order
to maintain that contemporary gender relations and the punitive production of gender identities are oppressive?
Foucault’s critique of the repressive-hypothesis in The History of
Sexuality,Volume I argues that (a) the structuralist “law” might be understood as one formation of power, a specific historical configuration and
that (b) the law might be understood to produce or generate the desire
it is said to repress.The </span><span class="c-1">object of repression is not the desire it takes to be
its ostensible object, but the multiple configurations of power </span><span class="c-0">itself, the
very plurality of which would displace the seeming universality and
necessity of the juridical or repressive law. In other words, desire and its
repression are an occasion for the consolidation of juridical structures;
desire is manufactured and forbidden as a ritual symbolic gesture
whereby the juridical model exercises and consolidates its own power.
The incest taboo is the juridical law that is said both to prohibit
incestuous desires and to construct certain gendered subjectivities
through the mechanism of compulsory identification. But what is to
guarantee the universality or necessity of this law? Clearly, there are
anthropological debates that seek to affirm and to dispute the universality of the incest taboo,46 and there is a second-order dispute over
~
what, if anything, the claim to universality might imply about the
meaning of social processes.47 To claim that a law is universal is not to
claim that it operates in the same way crossculturally or that it determines social life in some unilateral way. Indeed, the attribution of universality to a law may simply imply that it operates as a dominant
framework within which social relations take place. Indeed, to claim
the universal presence of a law in social life is in no way to claim that it
exists in every aspect of the social form under consideration; minimally, it means that it exists and operates somewhere in every social form.
My task here is not to show that there are cultures in which the
incest taboo as such does not operate, but rather to underscore the
generativity of that taboo, where it does operate, and not merely its
juridical status. In other words, not only does the taboo forbid and dictate sexuality in certain forms, but it inadvertently produces a variety
of substitute desires and identities that are in no sense constrained in
advance, except insofar as they are “substitutes” in some sense. If we
extend the Foucaultian critique to the incest taboo, then it seems that
the taboo and the original desire for mother/father can be historicized
in ways that resist the formulaic universality of Lacan.The taboo might
be understood to create and sustain the desire for the mother/father as
well as the compulsory displacement of that desire. The notion of an
“original” sexuality forever repressed and forbidden thus becomes a
production of the law which subsequently functions as its prohibition.
If the mother is the original desire, and that may well be true for a
wide range of late-capitalist household dwellers, then that is a desire
both produced and prohibited within the terms of that cultural context. In other words, the law which prohibits that union is the selfsame
law that invites it, and it is no longer possible to isolate the repressive
from the productive function of the juridical incest taboo.
Clearly, psychoanalytic theory has always recognized the productive function of the incest taboo; it is what creates heterosexual desire
and discrete gender identity. Psychoanalysis has also been clear that
the incest taboo does not always operate to produce gender and desire
~
in the ways intended. The example of the negative Oedipal complex
is but one occasion in which the prohibition against incest is clearly
stronger with respect to the opposite-sexed parent than the same-sexed
parent, and the parent prohibited becomes the figure of identification.
But how would this example be redescribed within the conception of
the incest taboo as both juridical and generative? The desire for the parent who, tabooed, becomes the figure of identification is both produced
and denied by the same mechanism of power. But for what end? If the
</span><span class="c-3">incest taboo regulates the production of discrete gender identities, and
if that production requires the prohibition and sanction of heterosexuality, then homosexuality emerges as a desire which must be produced
in order to remain repressed. In other words, for heterosexuality to
remain intact as a distinct social form, it requires an intelligible conception of homosexuality </span><span class="c-1">and also requires the prohibition of that conception in rendering it culturally unintelligible.</span><span class="c-0"> Within psychoanalysis,
bisexuality and homosexuality are taken to be primary libidinal dispositions, and </span><span class="c-1">heterosexuality is the laborious construction based upon
their gradual repression.</span><span class="c-0">While this doctrine seems to have a subversive
possibility to it, the discursive construction of both bisexuality and
homosexuality within the psychoanalytic literature effectively refutes
the claim to its precultural status. The discussion of the language of
bisexual dispositions above is a case in point.48
The bisexuality that is said to be “outside” the Symbolic and that serves
as the locus of subversion is, in fact, a construction within the terms of
that constitutive discourse, the construction of an “outside” that is nevertheless fully “inside,” not a possibility beyond culture, but a concrete
cultural possibility that is refused and redescribed as impossible.What
</span><span class="c-1">remains “unthinkable” and “unsayable” within the terms of an existing
cultural form is not necessarily what is excluded </span><span class="c-0">from the matrix of
intelligibility within that form; on the contrary, it is the marginalized,
not the excluded, the cultural possibility that calls for dread or, mini-

~
mally, the loss of sanctions. Not to </span><span class="c-1">have social recognition as an effective heterosexual is to lose one possible social identity and perhaps to
gain one that is radically less sanctioned.The “unthinkable” is thus fully
within culture, but fully excluded from dominant culture. The theory
which presumes bisexuality or homosexuality as the “before” to culture and then locates that “priority” as the source of a prediscursive
subversion, effectively forbids from within the terms of the culture the
very subversion that it ambivalently defends </span><span class="c-0">and defends against. As I
will argue in the case of Kristeva, subversion thus becomes a futile gesture, entertained only in a derealized aesthetic mode which can never
be translated into other cultural practices.
In the case of the incest taboo, Lacan argues that desire (as opposed
to need) is instituted through that law. “Intelligible” existence within the
terms of the Symbolic requires both the institutionalization of desire
and its dissatisfaction, the necessary consequence of the repression of
the original pleasure and need associated with the maternal body. This
full pleasure that haunts desire as that which it can never attain is the
irrecoverable memory of pleasure before the law. Lacan is clear that
that pleasure before the law is only fantasized, that it recurs in the infinite phantasms of desire. But in what sense is the phantasm, itself forbidden from the literal recovery of an original pleasure, the constitution
of a fantasy of “originality” that may or may not correspond to a literal
libidinal state? Indeed, to what extent is such a question decidable within the terms of Lacanian theory? A displacement or substitution can
only be understood as such in relation to an original, one which in this
case can never be recovered or known.This speculative origin is always
speculated about from a retrospective position, from which it assumes
the character of an ideal.The sanctification of this pleasurable “beyond”
is instituted through the invocation of a Symbolic order that is essentially unchangeable.49 Indeed, one needs to read the drama of the
Symbolic, of desire, of the institution of sexual difference as a selfsupporting signifying economy that wields power in the marking off of

~
what can and cannot be thought within the terms of cultural intelligibility. Mobilizing the distinction between what is “before” and what is
“during” culture is one way to foreclose cultural possibilities from the
start. The “order of appearances,” the founding temporality of the
account, as much as it contests narrative coherence by introducing the
split into the subject and the fêlure into desire, reinstitutes a coherence
at the level of temporal exposition. As a result, this narrative strategy,
revolving upon the distinction between an irrecoverable origin and a
perpetually displaced present, makes all effort at recovering that origin
in the name of subversion inevitably belated.

Subversive Bodily Acts
i. The Body Politics of Julia Kristeva
</span><span class="c-1">Kristeva’s theory of the semiotic dimension of language at first appears
to engage Lacanian premises only to expose their limits and to offer a
specifically feminine locus of subversion of the paternal law within language.</span><span class="c-0">1 According to Lacan, the paternal law structures all linguistic sign<a name="b-25"></a>ification, termed “the Symbolic,” and so becomes a universal organizing
principle of culture itself. This law creates the possibility of meaningful
language and, hence, meaningful experience, through the repression of
primary libidinal drives, including the radical dependency of the child
on the maternal body. Hence, the Symbolic becomes possible by repudiating the primary relationship to the maternal body. The “subject” who
emerges as a consequence of this repression becomes a bearer or proponent of this repressive law.The libidinal chaos characteristic of that early
dependency is now fully constrained by a unitary agent whose language
is structured by that law.This language, in turn, structures the world by
suppressing multiple meanings (which always recall the libidinal multiplicity which characterized the primary relation to the maternal body)
and instating univocal and discrete meanings in their place.
Kristeva challenges the Lacanian narrative which assumes cultural
meaning requires the repression of that primary relationship to the
maternal body. She argues that the “semiotic” is a dimension of language
occasioned by that primary maternal body, which not only refutes
Lacan’s primary premise, but serves as a perpetual source of subversion
within the Symbolic. For Kristeva, the semiotic expresses that original
~
libidinal multiplicity within the very terms of culture, more precisely,
within poetic language in which multiple meanings and semantic nonclosure prevail. In effect, </span><span class="c-1">poetic language is the recovery of the maternal body within the terms of language, one that has the potential to
disrupt, subvert,</span><span class="c-0"> and displace the paternal law.
Despite her critique of Lacan, however, Kristeva’s strategy of subversion proves doubtful. Her theory </span><span class="c-1">appears to depend upon the stability and reproduction of precisely the paternal law that she seeks to
displace.</span><span class="c-0"> Although she effectively exposes the limits of Lacan’s efforts
to universalize the paternal law in language, she nevertheless concedes
that the semiotic is invariably subordinate to the Symbolic, that it
assumes its specificity within the terms of a hierarchy immune to challenge. If the semiotic promotes the possibility of the subversion, displacement, or disruption of the paternal law, what meanings can those
terms have if the Symbolic always reasserts its hegemony?
The criticism of Kristeva which follows takes issue with several
steps in Kristeva’s argument in favor of the semiotic as a source of
effective subversion. First, it is unclear whether the primary relationship to the maternal body which both Kristeva and Lacan appear to
accept is a viable construct and whether it is even a knowable experience according to either of their linguistic theories. The multiple
drives that characterize the semiotic constitute a prediscursive libidinal economy which occasionally makes itself known in language, but
which maintains an ontological status prior to language itself. Manifest
in language, in poetic language in particular, this prediscursive libidinal
economy becomes a locus of cultural subversion. A second problem
emerges when Kristeva argues that this libidinal source of subversion
cannot be maintained within the terms of culture, that its sustained
presence within culture leads to psychosis and to the breakdown of
cultural life itself. Kristeva thus alternately posits and denies the semiotic as an emancipatory ideal.Though she </span><span class="c-1">tells us that it is a dimension
of language regularly repressed, she also concedes that it is a kind of
language which never can be consistently maintained.</span><span class="c-0">
~
In order to assess her seemingly self-defeating theory, we need to
ask how this libidinal multiplicity becomes manifest in language, and
what conditions its temporary lifespan there? Moreover, </span><span class="c-1">Kristeva
describes the maternal body as bearing a set of meanings that are prior
to culture itself. She thereby </span><span class="c-2">safeguards the notion of culture as a
paternal structure and delimits maternity as an essentially precultural
reality.</span><span class="c-1"> Her </span><span class="c-3">naturalistic descriptions of the maternal body effectively
reify motherhood and preclude an analysis of its cultural construction
and variability.</span><span class="c-0"> In asking whether a prediscursive libidinal multiplicity
is possible, we will also consider whether what Kristeva claims to discover in the prediscursive </span><span class="c-1">maternal body is itself a production of a
given historical discourse, an effect of culture rather than its secret and
primary cause.</span><span class="c-0">
Even if we accept Kristeva’s theory of primary drives, it is unclear
that the subversive effects of such drives can serve, via the semiotic, as
</span><span class="c-1">anything more than a temporary and futile disruption of the hegemony
of the paternal law.</span><span class="c-0"> I will try to show how the failure of her political
strategy follows in part from her largely uncritical appropriation of
drive theory. Moreover, upon careful scrutiny of her descriptions of
the semiotic function within language, it appears that Kristeva reinstates the paternal law at the level of the semiotic itself. In the end, it
seems that </span><span class="c-1">Kristeva offers us a </span><span class="c-2">strategy of subversion that can never
become a sustained political practice.</span><span class="c-0"> In the final part of this section, I
will suggest a way to reconceptualize the relation between drives, language, and patriarchal prerogative which might serve a more effective
strategy of subversion.
Kristeva’s description of the semiotic proceeds through a number
of problematic steps. She assumes that drives have aims prior to their
emergence into language, that language invariably represses or sublimates these drives, and that such drives are manifest only in those linguistic expressions which disobey, as it were, the univocal requirements
of signification within the Symbolic domain. She claims further that
the emergence of multiplicitous drives into language is evident in the
~
semiotic, that domain of linguistic meaning distinct from the Symbolic,
which is the maternal body manifest in poetic speech.
As early as Revolution in Poetic Language (1974), Kristeva argues for
a necessary causal relation between the heterogeneity of drives and the
plurivocal possibilities of poetic language. Differing from Lacan, she
maintains that poetic language is not predicated upon a repression of
primary drives. On the contrary, poetic language, she claims, is the linguistic occasion on which drives break apart the usual, univocal terms
of language and reveal an irrepressible heterogeneity of multiple
sounds and meanings. Kristeva thereby contests Lacan’s equation of
the Symbolic with all linguistic meaning by asserting that poetic language has its own modality of meaning which does not conform to the
requirements of univocal designation.
In this same work, she subscribes to a notion of free or uncathected energy which makes itself known in language through the poetic
function. She claims, for instance, that “in the intermingling of drives
in language . . . we shall see the economy of poetic language” and that
in this economy, “the unitary subject can no longer find his [sic]
place.”2 This poetic function is a rejective or divisive linguistic function which tends to fracture and multiply meanings; it enacts the heterogeneity of drives through the proliferation and destruction of
univocal signification. Hence, the urge toward a highly differentiated
or plurivocal set of meanings appears as the revenge of drives against
the rule of the Symbolic, which, in turn, is predicated upon their
repression. Kristeva defines the semiotic as the multiplicity of drives
manifest in language. With their insistent energy and heterogeneity,
these drives disrupt the signifying function. Thus, in this early work,
she defines the semiotic as “the signifying function . . . connected to
the modality [of] primary process.”3
In the essays that comprise Desire in Language (1977), Kristeva
ground her definition of the semiotic more fully in psychoanalytic
terms.The primary drives that the Symbolic represses and the semiotic
obliquely indicates are now understood as maternal drives, not only
~
those drives belonging to the mother, but those which characterize the
dependency of the infant’s body (of either sex) on the mother. In other
words, “the maternal body” designates a relation of continuity rather
than a discrete subject or object of desire; indeed, it designates that
jouissance which precedes desire and the subject/object dichotomy that
desire presupposes. While the Symbolic is predicated upon the rejection of the mother, the semiotic, through rhythm, assonance, intonations, sound play, and repetition, re-presents or recovers the maternal
body in poetic speech. Even the “first echolalias of infants” and the
“glossalalias in psychotic discourse” are manifestations of the continuity of the mother-infant relation, a heterogeneous field of impulse
prior to the separation/individuation of infant and mother, alike
effected by the imposition of the incest taboo.4 The separation of the
mother and infant effected by the taboo is expressed linguistically as
the severing of sound from sense. In Kristeva’s words, “a phoneme, as
distinctive element of meaning, belongs to language as Symbolic. But
this same phoneme is involved in rhythmic, intonational repetitions; it
thereby tends toward autonomy from meaning so as to maintain itself
in a semiotic disposition near the instinctual drive’s body.”5
The semiotic is described by Kristeva as destroying or eroding the
Symbolic; it is said to be “before” meaning, as when a child begins to
vocalize, or “after” meaning, as when a psychotic no longer uses words
to signify. If the </span><span class="c-1">Symbolic and the semiotic are understood as two
modalities of language, and if the semiotic is understood to be generally repressed by the Symbolic, then language for Kristeva is understood
as a system in which the Symbolic remains hegemonic except when the
semiotic disrupts its signifying process through elision, repetition,
mere sound, and the multiplication of meaning through indefinitely
signifying images and metaphors.</span><span class="c-0"> In its Symbolic mode, language rests
upon a severance of the relation of maternal dependency, whereby it
becomes abstract (abstracted from the materiality of language) and
univocal; this is most apparent in quantitative or purely formal reasoning. In its semiotic mode, language is engaged in a poetic recovery of
~
the maternal body, that diffuse materiality that resists all discrete and
univocal signification. Kristeva writes:
In any poetic language, not only do the rhythmic constraints, for
example, go so far as to violate certain grammatical rules of a national language . . . but in recent texts, these semiotic constraints
(rhythm, vocalic timbres in Symbolist work, but also graphic disposition on the page) are accompanied by nonrecoverable syntactic
elisions; it is impossible to reconstitute the particular elided syntactic category (object or verb), which ma<a name="b-26"></a>kes the meaning of the utterance decidable.6

For Kristeva, this undecidability is precisely the instinctual moment in language, its disruptive function. Poetic language thus suggests
a dissolution of the coherent, signifying subject into the primary continuity which is the maternal body:
Language as Symbolic function constitutes itself at the cost of repressing instinctual drive and continuous relation to the mother. On the
contrary, the unsettled and questionable subject of poetic language
(from whom the word is never uniquely sign) maintains itself at the
cost of reactivating this repressed, instinctual, maternal element.7

Kristeva’s references to the “subject” of poetic language are not wholly
appropriate, for poetic language erodes and destroys the subject,
where the subject is understood as a speaking being participating in the
Symbolic. Following Lacan, she maintains that the prohibition against
the incestuous union with the mother is the founding law of the subject, a foundation which severs or breaks the continuous relation of
maternal dependency. In creating the subject, the prohibitive law creates the domain of the Symbolic or language as a system of univocally
signifying signs. Hence, Kristeva concludes that “poetic language
would be for its questionable subject-in-process the equivalent of
incest.”8 The breaking of Symbolic language against its own founding
law or, equivalently, the emergence of rupture into language from
~
within its own interior instinctuality, is not merely the outburst of
libidinal heterogeneity into language; it also signifies the somatic state
of dependency on the maternal body prior to the individuation of the
ego. Poetic language thus always indicates a return to the maternal terrain, where the maternal signifies both libidinal dependency and the
heterogeneity of drives.
In “Motherhood According to Bellini,” Kristeva suggests that,
because the maternal body signifies the loss of coherent and discrete
identity, poetic language verges on psychosis. And in the case of a
woman’s semiotic expressions in language, the return to the maternal
signifies a prediscursive homosexuality that Kristeva also clearly associates with psychosis. Although Kristeva concedes that poetic language
is sustained culturally through its participation in the Symbolic and,
hence, in the norms of linguistic communicability, she fails to allow
that homosexuality is capable of the same nonpsychotic social expression.The key to Kristeva’s view of the psychotic nature of homosexuality is to be understood, I would suggest, in her acceptance of the
structuralist assumption that heterosexuality is coextensive with the
founding of the Symbolic. Hence, the cathexis of homosexual desire
can be achieved, according to Kristeva, only through displacements
that are sanctioned within the Symbolic, such as poetic language or the
act of giving birth:
By </span><span class="c-1">giving birth, the women enters into contact with her mother; she
becomes, she is her own mother; they are the same continuity differentiating itself. She thus actualizes the homosexual facet of motherhood, through which a woman is simultaneously closer to her
instinctual memory, more open to her psychosis, and consequently,
more negatory of the social, symbolic bond.9

According </span><span class="c-0">to Kristeva, the act of giving birth does not successfully
reestablish that continuous relation prior to individuation because
the infant invariably suffers the prohibition on incest and is separated
off as a discrete identity. In the case of the mother’s separation from
~
the girl-child, the result is melancholy for both, for the separation is
never fully completed.
As </span><span class="c-1">opposed to grief or mourning, in which separation is recognized and the libido attached to the original object is successfully displaced onto a new substitute object, </span><span class="c-2">melancholy designates a failure to
grieve in which the loss is simply internalized and, in that sense,
refused.</span><span class="c-0"> Instead of a negative attachment to the body, the maternal body
is internalized as a negation, so that the girl’s identity becomes itself a
kind of loss, a characteristic privation or lack.
The alleged psychosis of homosexuality, then, consists in its thorough break with the paternal law and with the grounding of the female
“ego,” tenuous though it may be, in the melancholic response to separation from the maternal body. Hence, according to Kristeva, female
homosexuality is the emergence of psychosis into culture:
The homosexual-maternal facet is a whirl of words, a complete
absence of meaning and seeing; it is feeling, displacement, rhythm,
sound, flashes, and fantasied clinging to the maternal body as a
screen against the plunge . . . for woman, a paradise lost but seemingly close at hand.10

For women, however, this homosexuality is manifest in poetic language which becomes, in fact, the only form of the semiotic, besides
childbirth, which can be sustained within the terms of the Symbolic.
For Kristeva, then, overt homosexuality cannot be a culturally sustainable activity, for it would constitute a breaking of the incest taboo in an
unmediated way. And yet why is this the case?
Kristeva accepts the assumption that culture is equivalent to the
Symbolic, that the Symbolic is fully subsumed under the “Law of the
Father,” and that the only modes of nonpsychotic activity are those
which participate in the Symbolic to some extent. Her strategic task,
then, is neither to replace the Symbolic with the semiotic nor to
~
tion of the borders which divide the Symbolic from the semiotic. Just
as birth is understood to be a cathexis of instinctual drives for the purposes of a social teleology, so poetic production is conceived as the
site in which the split between instinct and representation exists in
culturally communicable form:
The speaker reaches this limit, this requisite of sociality, only by
</span><span class="c-2">virtue of a particular, discursive practice called “art.” A woman also
attains it (and in our society, especially) through the strange form of
split symbolization (threshold of language and instinctual drive, of
the “symbolic” and the “semiotic”) of which the act of giving birth
consists.</span><span class="c-0">11

Hence, for Kristeva, poetry and maternity represent privileged
practices within paternally sanctioned culture which permit a nonpsychotic experience of that heterogeneity and dependency characteristic
of the maternal terrain.These acts of poesis reveal an instinctual heterogeneity that subsequently exposes the repressed ground of the Symbolic, challenges the mastery of the univocal signifier, and diffuses the
autonomy of the subject who postures as their necessary ground. The
heterogeneity of drives operates culturally as a subversive strategy of
displacement, one which dislodges the hegemony of the paternal law
by releasing the repressed multiplicity interior to language itself.
Precisely because that instinctual heterogeneity must be re-presented
in and through the paternal law, it cannot defy the incest taboo altogether, but must remain within the most fragile regions of the
Symbolic. Obedient, then, to syntactical requirements, the poeticmaternal practices of displacing the paternal law always remain tenuously tethered to that law. Hence, a </span><span class="c-1">full-scale refusal of the Symbolic is
impossible, and a discourse of “emancipation,” for Kristeva,</span><span class="c-0"> is out of
the question. At best, tactical subversions and displacements of the law
challenge its self-grounding presumption. But, once again, Kristeva
does not seriously challenge the structuralist assumption that the
prohibitive paternal law is foundational to culture itself. Hence, the
~
subversion of paternally sanctioned culture can not come from another
version of culture, but only from within the repressed interior of culture itself, from the heterogeneity of drives that constitutes culture’s
concealed foundation.
This relation between heterogeneous drives and the paternal law
produces an exceedingly problematic view of psychosis. On the one
hand, it designates female homosexuality as a culturally unintelligible
practice, inherently psychotic: on the other hand, it mandates maternity as a compulsory defense against libidinal chaos. Although Kristeva
does not make either claim explicitly, both implications follow from
her views on the law, language, and drives. Consider that for Kristeva
poetic language breaks the incest taboo and, as such, verges always
on psychosis. As a return to the maternal body and a concomitant deindividuation of the ego, poetic language becomes especially threatening when uttered by women. The poetic then contests not only the
incest taboo, but the taboo against homosexuality as well. Poetic language is thus, for women, both displaced maternal dependency and,
because that dependency is libidinal, displaced homosexuality.
For Kristeva, the unmediated cathexis of female homosexual
desire leads unequivocally to psychosis. Hence, one can satisfy this
drive only through a series of displacements: the incorporation of
maternal identity—that is, by becoming a mother oneself—or
through poetic language which manifests obliquely the heterogeneity
of drives characteristic of maternal dependency. As the only socially
sanctioned and, hence, nonpsychotic displacements for homosexual
desire, both maternity and poetry constitute melancholic experiences
for women appropriately acculturated into heterosexuality. The heterosexual poet-mother suffers interminably from the displacement of
the homosexual cathexis. And yet, the consummation of this </span><span class="c-1">desire
would lead to the psychotic unraveling of identity, according to
Kristeva—the presumption being that, for women, heterosexuality
and coherent selfhood are indissolubly linked.</span><span class="c-0">
How are we to understand this constitution of lesbian experience
~
as the site of an irretrievable self-loss? Kristeva clearly takes heterosexuality to be prerequisite to kinship and to culture. Consequently, she
identifies lesbian experience as the psychotic alternative to the acceptance of paternally sanctioned laws. And yet why is lesbianism constituted as psychosis? From what cultural perspective is lesbianism
constructed as a site of fusion, self-loss, and psychosis?
By projecting the lesbian as “Other” to culture, and </span><span class="c-1">characterizing
lesbian speech as the psychotic “whirl-of-words,” Kristeva constructs
lesbian sexuality as intrinsically unintelligible.</span><span class="c-0"> This </span><span class="c-1">tactical dismissal
and reduction of lesbian experience performed in the name of the law
positions Kristeva within the orbit of paternal-heterosexual privilege.</span><span class="c-0">
The paternal law which protects her from this radical incoherence is
precisely the mechanism that produces the construct of lesbianism as a
site of irrationality. Significantly, this description of lesbian experience
is effected from the outside and tells us more about the fantasies that a
fearful heterosexual culture produces to defend against its own homosexual possibil<a name="b-27"></a>ities than about lesbian experience itself.
In </span><span class="c-1">claiming that lesbianism designates a loss of self, Kristeva
appears to be delivering a psychoanalytic truth about the repression
necessary for individuation.</span><span class="c-0"> The fear of such a “regression” to homosexuality is, then, a fear of losing cultural sanction and privilege altogether. Although Kristeva claims that this loss designates a place prior
to culture, there is no reason not to understand it as a new or unacknowledged cultural form. In other words, Kristeva prefers to explain
lesbian experience as a regressive libidinal state prior to acculturation
itself, rather than to take up the challenge that lesbianism offers to her
restricted view of paternally sanctioned cultural laws. Is the fear
encoded in the construction of the lesbian as psychotic the result of a
developmentally necessitated repression, or is it, rather, the fear of losing cultural legitimacy and, hence, being cast, not outside or prior to
culture, but outside cultural legitimacy, still within culture, but culturally “out-lawed”?
Kristeva describes both the maternal body and lesbian experience
~
from a position of sanctioned heterosexuality that fails to acknowledge
its own fear of losing that sanction. Her reification of the paternal law
not only repudiates female homosexuality, but denies the varied meanings and possibilities of motherhood as a cultural practice. But cultural
subversion is not really Kristeva’s concern, for subversion, when it
appears, emerges from beneath the surface of culture only inevitably to
return there. Although the semiotic is a possibility of language that
escapes the paternal law, it remains inevitably within or, indeed,
beneath the territory of that law. Hence, </span><span class="c-1">poetic language and the pleasures of maternity constitute local displacements of the paternal law,
temporary subversions which finally submit to that against which they
initially rebel.</span><span class="c-0"> By </span><span class="c-2">relegating the source of subversion to a site outside of
culture itself, Kristeva appears to foreclose the possibility of subversion
as an effective or realizable cultural practice.</span><span class="c-0"> </span><span class="c-1">Pleasure beyond the paternal law can be imagined only together with its inevitable impossibility.</span><span class="c-0">
Kristeva’s theory of thwarted subversion is premised on her problematic view of the relation among drives, language, and the law. Her
postulation of a subversive multiplicity of drives raises a number of
epistemological and political questions. In the first place, if these
drives are manifest only in language or cultural forms already determined as Symbolic, then how is it that we can verify their preSymbolic ontological status? Kristeva argues that poetic language gives
us access to these drives in their fundamental multiplicity, but this
answer is not fully satisfactory. Since poetic language is said to depend
upon the prior existence of these multiplicitous drives, we cannot,
then, in circular fashion, justify the postulated existence of these drives
through recourse to poetic language. If </span><span class="c-1">drives must first be repressed
for language to exist, and if we can </span><span class="c-2">attribute meaning only to that
which is representable in language, then to attribute meaning to drives
prior to their emergence into language is impossible.</span><span class="c-0"> Similarly, to
attribute a causality to drives which facilitates their transformation
into language and by which language itself is to be explained cannot
reasonably be done within the confines of language itself. In other
~
words, we know these drives as “causes” only in and through their
effects, and, as such, we have no reason for not identifying drives with
their effects. It follows that either (a) drives and their representations
are coextensive or (b) representations preexist the drives themselves.
This last alterative is, I would argue, an important one to consider,
for how do we know that the instinctual object of Kristeva’s discourse
is not a construction of the discourse itself? And what grounds do we
have for positing this object, this multiplicitous field, as prior to signification? If poetic language must participate in the Symbolic in order
to be culturally communicable, and if Kristeva’s own theoretical texts
are emblematic of the Symbolic, then where are we to find a convincing “outside” to this domain? Her postulation of a prediscursive corporeal multiplicity becomes all the more problematic when we discover
that maternal drives are considered part of a “biological destiny” and
are themselves manifestations of “a non-symbolic, nonpaternal causality.” 12 This pre-Symbolic, nonpaternal causality is, for Kristeva, a semiotic, maternal causality, or, more specifically, a teleological conception
of maternal instincts:
Material compulsion, spasm of a memory belonging to the species
that either binds together or splits apart to perpetuate itself, series of
markers with no other significance than the eternal return of the
life-death biological cycle. How can we verbalize this prelinguistic,
unrepresentable memory? Heraclitus’ flux, Epicurus’ atoms, the
whirling dust of cabalic, Arab and Indian mystics, and the stippled
drawings of psychedelics—all seem better metaphors than the theory of Being, the logos, and its laws.13

Here, the repressed maternal body is not only the locus of multiple drives, but the bearer of a biological teleology as well, one which,
it seems, makes itself evident in the early stages of Western philosophy,
in non-Western religious beliefs and practices, in aesthetic representations produced by psychotic or near-psychotic states, and even in
avant-garde artistic practices. But why are we to assume that these
~
various cultural expressions manifest the selfsame principle of maternal heterogeneity? Kristeva simply subordinates each of these cultural
moments to the same principle. Consequently, the semiotic represents
any cultural effort to displace the logos (which, curiously, she contrasts
with Heraclitus’ flux), where the logos represents the univocal signifier, the law of identity. Her opposition between the semiotic and the
Symbolic reduces here to a metaphysical quarrel between the principle
of multiplicity that escapes the charge of non-contradiction and a principle of identity based on the suppression of that multiplicity. Oddly,
that very principle of multiplicity that Kristeva everywhere defends
operates in much the same manner as a principle of identity. Note the
way in which all manner of things “primitive” and “Oriental” are summarily subordinated to the principle of the maternal body. Surely, her
description warrants not only the charge of Orientalism, but raises the
very significant question of whether, ironically, multiplicity has
become a univocal signifier.
Her ascription of a teleological aim to maternal drives prior to
their constitution in language or culture raises a number of questions
about Kristeva’s political program. Although she clearly sees subversive
and disruptive potential in those semiotic expressions that challenge the
hegemony of the paternal law, it is less clear in what precisely this subversion consists. If the law is understood to rest on a constructed
ground, beneath which lurks the repressed maternal terrain, what concrete cultural options emerge within the terms of culture as a consequence of this revelation? Ostensibly, the multiplicity associated with
the maternal libidinal economy has the force to disperse the univocity
of the paternal signifier and seemingly to create the possibility of other
cultural expressions no longer tightly constrained by the law of noncontradiction. But is this disruptive activity the opening of a field of significations, or is it the manifestation of a biological archaism which
operates according to a natural and “prepaternal” causality? If Kristeva
believed the former were the case (and she does not), then she would
~
ating field of cultural possibilities. But instead, she </span><span class="c-1">prescribes a return
to a principle of maternal heterogeneity which proves to be a closed
concept,</span><span class="c-0"> indeed, a heterogeneity confined by a teleology both unilinear
and univocal.
</span><span class="c-2">Kristeva understands the desire to give birth as a species-desire,
part of a collective and archaic female libidinal drive </span><span class="c-1">that constitutes
an ever-recurring metaphysical reality.</span><span class="c-0"> Here Kristeva reifies maternity
and then promotes this reification as the disruptive potential of the
semiotic. As a result, the paternal law, understood as the ground of
univocal signification, is displaced by an equally univocal signifier, the
principle of the maternal body which remains self-identical in its teleology regardless of its “multiplicitous” manifestations.
</span><span class="c-1">Insofar as Kristeva conceptualizes this maternal instinct as having
an ontological status prior to the paternal law, she fails to consider the
way in which that very law might well be the cause of the very desire it
is said to repress.</span><span class="c-0"> Rather than the manifestation of a prepaternal causality, these desires might attest to maternity as a social practice required
and recapitulated by the exigencies of kinship. Kristeva accepts LéviStrauss’s analysis of the exchange of women as prerequisite for the
consolidation of kinship bonds. She understands this exchange, however, as the cultural moment in which the maternal body is repressed,
rather than as a mechanism for the compulsory cultural construction
of the female body as a maternal body. Indeed, we might understand
the exchange of women as imposing a compulsory obligation on
women’s bodies to reproduce. According to Gayle Rubin’s reading of
Lévi-Strauss, kinship effects a “sculpting of . . . sexuality” such that the
desire to give birth is the result of social practices which require and
produce such desires in order to effect their reproductive ends.14
What grounds, then, does Kristeva have for imputing a maternal
teleology to the female body prior to its emergence into culture?
To pose the question in this way is already to question the distinction
between the Symbolic and the semiotic on which her conception of
the maternal body is premised. The maternal body in its originary
~
signification is considered by Kristeva to be prior to signification
itself; hence, it becomes impossible within her framework to consider
the maternal itself as a signification, open to cultural variability. Her
argument makes clear that maternal drives constitute those primary
processes that language invariably represses or sublimates. But perhaps her argument could be recast within an even more encompassing
framework: What cultural configuration of language, indeed, of discourse, generates the trope of a pre-discursive libidinal multiplicity, and
for what purposes?
By restricting the paternal law to a prohibitive or repressive function, Kristeva fails to understand the paternal mechanisms by which
affectivity itself is generated. The </span><span class="c-1">law that is said to repress the semiotic may well be the governing princip<a name="b-28"></a>le of the semiotic itself, with the
result that what </span><span class="c-4">passes as “maternal instinct” may well be a culturally
constructed desire which is interpreted through a naturalistic vocabulary.</span><span class="c-0"> And if that desire is constructed according to a law of kinship
which requires the heterosexual production and reproduction of
desire, then the vocabulary of naturalistic affect effectively renders
that “paternal law” invisible.What for Kristeva is a pre-paternal causality would then appear as a paternal causality under the guise of a natural or distinctively maternal causality.
Significantly, the figuration of the maternal body and the teleology
of its </span><span class="c-2">instincts as a self-identical and insistent metaphysical principle—an archaism of a collective, sex-specific biological constitution—bases itself on a univocal conception of the female sex. And this
sex, conceived as both origin and causality, poses as a principle of pure
</span><span class="c-0">generativity. Indeed, for Kristeva, it is equated with poesis itself, that
activity of making upheld in Plato’s Symposium as an act of birth and
poetic conception at once.15 But is female generativity truly an
uncaused cause, and does it begin the narrative that takes all of
humanity under the force of the incest taboo and into language? Does
the pre-paternal causality whereof Kristeva speaks signify a primary
female economy of pleasure and meaning? Can we reverse the very
~
order of this causality and understand this semiotic economy as a production of a prior discourse?
In the final chapter of Foucault’s first volume of The History of Sexuality,
he cautions against using the category of sex as a “fictitious unity . . .
[and] causal principle” and argues that the fictitious category of sex
facilitates a reversal of causal relations such that “sex” is understood to
cause the structure and meaning of desire:
the notion of ‘</span><span class="c-2">sex’ made it possible to group together, in an </span><span class="c-3">artificial
</span><span class="c-5">unity, </span><span class="c-6">anatomical elements, biological functions, conducts, sensations, and pleasures,</span><span class="c-3"> and it enabled one to make use of this </span><span class="c-2">fictitious
unity as a causal principle, an omnipresent </span><span class="c-1">meaning: sex was thus
able to function as a unique signifier and as a universal signified.16

For </span><span class="c-2">Foucault,</span><span class="c-1"> the body is not “sexed” in any significant sense prior to
its determination within a discourse through which it becomes invested with an “idea” of </span><span class="c-2">natural or essential sex. The body gains meaning
within </span><span class="c-1">discourse only in the context of power relations.</span><span class="c-0"> </span><span class="c-2">Sexuality is an
historically specific organization of power, discourse, bodies, and
affectivity.</span><span class="c-0"> As such, sexuality is understood by Foucault to produce
“</span><span class="c-2">sex” as an artificial concept which effectively extends and disguises
the power relations responsible for its genesis.</span><span class="c-0">
Foucault’s framework suggests a way to solve some of the epistemological and political difficulties that follow from Kristeva’s view of
the female body.We can understand Kristeva’s assertion of a “prepaternal causality” as fundamentally inverted. Whereas Kristeva posits a
maternal body prior to discourse that exerts its own causal force in the
structure of drives, Foucault would doubtless argue that the discursive
production of the maternal body as prediscursive is a tactic in the selfamplification and concealment of those specific power relations by
which the trope of the maternal body is produced. In these terms, the
maternal body would no longer be understood as the hidden ground of
all signification, the tacit cause of all culture. It would be understood,
~
rather, as an effect or consequence of a system of sexuality in which the
female body is required to assume maternity as the essence of its self
and the law of its desire.
If we accept Foucault’s framework, we are compelled to redescribe the maternal libidinal economy as a product of an historically
specific organization of sexuality. Moreover, the discourse of sexuality,
itself suffused by power relations, becomes the true ground of the
trope of the prediscursive maternal body. Kristeva’s formulation suffers a thoroughgoing reversal: The Symbolic and the semiotic are no
longer interpreted as those dimensions of language which follow upon
the repression or manifestation of the maternal libidinal economy.This
very economy is understood instead as a reification that both extends
and conceals the institution of motherhood as compulsory for women.
Indeed, when the desires that maintain the institution of motherhood
are transvaluated as pre-paternal and pre-cultural drives, then the
institution gains a permanent legitimation in the invariant structures
of the female body. Indeed, the clearly paternal law that sanctions and
requires the female body to be characterized primarily in terms of its
reproductive function is inscribed on that body as the law of its natural
necessity. Kristeva, safeguarding that law of a biologically necessitated
maternity as a subversive operation that pre-exists the paternal law
itself, aids in the systematic production of its invisibility and, consequently, the illusion of its inevitability.
Because Kristeva restricts herself to an exclusively prohibitive conception of the paternal law, she is unable to account for the ways in
which the paternal </span><span class="c-1">law generates certain desires in the form of natural
drives.</span><span class="c-0"> The female body that she seeks to express is itself a construct
produced by the very law it is supposed to undermine. In no way do
these criticisms of Kristeva’s conception of the paternal law necessarily invalidate her general position that culture or the Symbolic is predicated upon a repudiation of women’s bodies. I want to suggest,
however, that any theory that asserts that signification is predicated
upon the denial or repression of a female principle ought to consider
~
whether that femaleness is really external to the cultural norms by
which it is repressed. In other words, on my reading, the </span><span class="c-1">repression of
the feminine does not require that the agency of repression and the
object of repression be ontologically distinct. Indeed, repression may
be understood to produce the object that it comes to deny.</span><span class="c-0"> That production may well be an elaboration of the agency of repression itself.
As Foucault makes clear, the culturally contradictory enterprise of the
mechanism of repression is prohibitive and generative at once and
makes the problematic of “liberation” especially acute.The female body
that is freed from the shackles of the paternal law may well prove to be
yet another incarnation of that law, posing as subversive but operating
in the service of that law’s self-amplification and proliferation. In order
to avoid the emancipation of the oppressor in the name of the
oppressed, it is necessary to take into account the full complexity and
subtlety of the law and to </span><span class="c-1">cure ourselves of the illusion of a true body
beyond the law. If </span><span class="c-8">subversion is possible, it will be a subversion from
within the terms of the law,</span><span class="c-7"> through the possibilities that emerge when
the law turns against itself and spawns unexpected permutations </span><span class="c-2">of
itself. The </span><span class="c-3">culturally constructed body will then be liberated, neither
to its “natural” past, nor to its original pleasures, but to an open future
of cultural possibilities.</span><span class="c-0">
ii. Foucault, Herculine, and the Politics
of Sexual Discontinuity
Foucault’s genealogical critique has provided a way to criticize those
Lacanian and neo-Lacanian theories that cast culturally marginal forms
of sexuality as culturally unintelligible. Writing within the terms of a
disillusionment with the notion of a liberatory Eros, Foucault understands sexuality as saturated with power and offers a critical view of
theories that lay claim to a sexuality before or after the law. When we
consider, however, </span><span class="c-1">those textual occasions on which Foucault criticizes
the categories of sex and the power regime of sexuality, it is clear that
his own theory maintains an unacknowledged emancipatory ideal that
~
proves increasingly difficult to maintain, even within the strictures of
his own critical apparatus.</span><span class="c-0">
Foucault’s theory of sexuality offered in The History of Sexuality,
Volume I is in some ways contradicted by his short but significant introduction to the journals he published of Herculine Barbin, a nineteenthcentury French hermaphrodite. Herculine was assigned the sex of
“female” at birth. In h/er early twenties, after a series of confessions to
doctors and priests, s/he was legally compelled to change h/er sex to
“male.” The journals that Foucault claims to have found are published
in this collection, along with the medical and legal documents that discuss the basis on which the designation of h/er “true” sex was decided.
A satiric short story by the German writer, Oscar Panizza, is also
included. Foucault supplies an introduction to the English translation
of the text in which he questions whether the notion of a true sex is
necessary. At first, this question appears to be continuous with the
critical genealogy of the category of “sex” he offers toward the conclusion of the first volume of The History of Sexuality.17 However, the journals and their introduction offer an occasion to consider Foucault’s
reading of Herculine against his theory of sexuality in The History of
Sexuality,Volume I. Although he argues in The History of Sexuality that
sexuality is coextensive with power, he fails to recognize the concrete
relations of power that both construct and condemn Herculine’s sexuality. Indeed, he </span><span class="c-2">appears to romanticize h/er world of pleasures as the
“happy limbo of a non-</span><span class="c-0">identity” (xiii), a world that exceeds the categories of sex and of identity.The reemergence of a discourse on sexual
difference and the categories of sex within Herculine’s own autobiographical writings will lead to an alternative reading of Herculine
against Foucault’s romanticized appropriation and refusal of her text.
In the first volume of The History of Sexuality, Foucault argues that
the univocal construct of “sex” (one is one’s sex and, therefore, not the
other) is (a) produced in the service of the social regulation and control of sexuality and (b) conceals and artificially unifies a variety of disparate and unrelated sexual functions and then (c) postures within
~
discourse as a cause, an interior essence which both produces and renders intelligible all manner of sensation, pleasure, and desire as sexspecific. In other words, bodily pleasures are not merely causally
reducible to this ostensibly sex-specific essence, but they become readily interpretable as manifestations or signs of this “sex.”18
In </span><span class="c-1">opposition to this false construction of “sex” as both univocal and
causal, Foucault engages a reverse-discourse which treats “sex” as
an effect rather than an origin. In the place of “sex” as the original and
continuous cause and signification of bodily pleasures, he proposes
</span><span class="c-0">“sexuality” as an open and complex historical system of discourse and
power that produces the misnomer of<a name="b-29"></a> “sex” as part of a strategy to conceal and, hence, to perpetuate power-relations. One way in which
power is both perpetuated and concealed is through the </span><span class="c-1">establishment
of an external or arbitrary relation between power, conceived as
repression or domination, and sex, conceived as a brave but thwarted
energy waiting for release or authentic self-expression.</span><span class="c-0">The use of this
juridical model presumes that the relation between power and sexuality is not only ontologically distinct, but that power always and only
works to subdue or liberate a sex which is fundamentally intact, selfsufficient, and other than power itself. When “sex” is essentialized in
this way, it becomes ontologically immunized from power relations
and from its own historicity. As a result, the analysis of sexuality is collapsed into the analysis of “sex,” and any inquiry into the historical production of the category of “sex” itself is precluded by this inverted and
falsifying causality. According to Foucault, “sex” must not only be
recontextualized within the terms of sexuality, but juridical power
must be reconceived as a construction produced by a generative power
which, in turn, conceals the mechanism of its own productivity.
the notion of </span><span class="c-2">sex brought about a fundamental reversal; it made it
possible to invert the representation of the </span><span class="c-3">relationships of power to
sexuality, causing the latter to appear, not in its essential and positive

~
relation to power, but as being rooted in a specific and irreducible
urgency which power tries as best it can to dominate.</span><span class="c-2"> (154)

Foucault </span><span class="c-0">explicitly takes a stand against emancipatory or liberationist models of sexuality in The History of Sexuality because they
subscribe to a juridical model that does not acknowledge the historical production of “sex” as a category, that is, as a mystifying “effect” of
power relations. His ostensible problem with feminism seems also to
emerge here: Where feminist analysis takes the category of sex and,
thus, according to him, the binary restriction on gender, as its point of
departure, Foucault understands his own project to be an inquiry into
how the category of “sex” and sexual difference </span><span class="c-1">are constructed within
discourse as necessary features of bodily identity.</span><span class="c-0"> The juridical model
of law which structures the feminist emancipatory model presumes, in
his view, that the subject of emancipation, “the sexed body” in some
sense, is not itself in need of a critical deconstruction. As Foucault
remarks about some humanist efforts at prison reform, the criminal
subject who gets emancipated may be even more deeply shackled
than the humanist originally thought. To be </span><span class="c-3">sexed, for Foucault, is to
be subjected to a set of social regulations, to have the law that directs
those regulations reside both as the formative principle of one’s sex,
gender, pleasures, and desires and as the hermeneutic principle </span><span class="c-1">of selfinterpretation.</span><span class="c-0"> The category of sex is thus inevitably regulative, and
any analysis which makes that category presuppositional uncritically
extends and further legitimates that regulative strategy as a power/
knowledge regime.
In editing and publishing the journals of Herculine Barbin,
Foucault is clearly trying to show how an hermaphroditic or intersexed body implicitly exposes and refutes the regulative strategies of
sexual categorization. Because he thinks that “sex” unifies bodily functions and meanings that have no necessary relationship with one another, he predicts that the disappearance of “sex” results in a happy
dispersal of these various functions, meanings, organs, somatic and
~
physiological processes as well as in the proliferation of pleasures outside of the framework of intelligibility enforced by univocal sexes
within a binary relation.The sexual world in which Herculine resides,
according to Foucault, is one in which bodily pleasures do not immediately signify “sex” as their primary cause and ultimate meaning; it is a
world, he claims, in which “grins hung about without the cat” (xiii).
Indeed, these are pleasures that clearly transcend the regulation
imposed upon them, and here we see Foucault’s sentimental indulgence in the very emancipatory discourse his analysis in The History of
Sexuality was meant to displace. According to this Foucaultian model of
emancipatory sexual politics, the overthrow of “sex” results in the
release of a primary sexual multiplicity, a notion not so far afield from
the psychoanalytic postulation of primary polymorphousness or
Marcuse’s notion of an original and creative bisexual Eros subsequently repressed by an instrumentalist culture.
The significant difference between Foucault’s position in the first volume of The History of Sexuality and in his introduction to Herculine
Barbin is already to be found as an unresolved tension within the History
of Sexuality itself (he refers there to “bucolic” and “innocent” </span><span class="c-1">pleasures
of intergenerational sexual exchange that exist prior to the imposition
of various regulative strategies </span><span class="c-0">[31]). On the one hand, Foucault wants
to argue that there is no “sex” in itself which is not produced by complex interactions of discourse and power, and yet there does seem to
be a “multiplicity of pleasures” in itself which is not the effect of any
specific discourse/power exchange. In other words, Foucault invokes a
</span><span class="c-1">trope of prediscursive libidinal multiplicity that effectively presupposes a sexuality “before the law,” indeed, a sexuality </span><span class="c-0">waiting for emancipation from the shackles of “sex.” On the other hand, Foucault
officially insists that sexuality and power are coextensive and that we
</span><span class="c-2">must not think that by saying yes to sex we say no to power.</span><span class="c-0"> In his antijuridical and anti-emancipatory mode, the “official” Foucault argues
that sexuality is always situated within matrices of power, that it is
~
always produced or constructed within specific historical practices,
both discursive and institutional, and that recourse to a sexuality
before the law is an illusory and complicitous conceit of emancipatory
sexual politics.
The journals of Herculine provide the opportunity to read
Foucault against himself, or, perhaps more appropriately, to expose the
constitutive contradiction of this kind of anti-emancipatory call for
sexual freedom. Herculine, called Alexina throughout the text, narrates a story about h/er tragic plight as one who lives a life of unjust
victimization, deceit, longing, and inevitable dissatisfaction. From the
time s/he was a young girl, s/he reports, s/he was different from the
other girls. This difference is a cause for alternating states of anxiety
and self-importance through the story, but it is there as tacit knowledge before the law becomes an explicit actor in the story. Although
Herculine does not report directly on h/er anatomy in the journals,
the medical reports that Foucault publishes along with Herculine’s
own text suggest that Herculine might reasonably be said to have what
is described as either a small penis or an enlarged clitoris, that where
one might expect to find a vagina one finds a “cul-de-sac,” as the doctors put it, and, further, that she doesn’t appear to have identifiably
female breasts. There seems also to be some capacity for ejaculation
that is not fully accounted for within the medical documents.
Herculine never refers to anatomy as such, but relates h/er predicament in terms of a natural mistake, a metaphysical homelessness, a
state of insatiable desire, and a radical solitariness that, before h/er
suicide, is transformed into a full-blown rage, first directed toward
men, but finally toward the world as such.
Herculine relates in elliptical terms h/er relations with the girls at
school, the “mothers” at the convent, and finally h/er most passionate
attachment with Sara who becomes h/er lover. Plagued first with guilt
and then with some unspecified genital ailment, Herculine exposes
h/er secret to a doctor and then a priest, a set of confessional acts that
effectively force h/er separation from Sara. Authorities confer and
~
effect h/er legal transformation into a man whereupon s/he is legally
obligated to dress in men’s clothing and to exercise the various rights of
men in society. Written in a sentimental and melodramatic tone, the
journals report a sense of perpetual crisis that culminates in suicide.
One could argue that prior to the legal transformation of Alexina into a
man, s/he was free to enjoy those pleasures that are effectively free of
the juridical and regulatory pressures of the category of “sex.” Indeed,
Foucault appears to think that the journals provide insight into precisely
that unregulated field of pleasures prior to the imposition of the law of
univocal sex. His reading, however, constitutes a radical misreading of
the way in which those pleasures are always already embedded in the
pervasive but inarticulate law and, indeed, generated by the very law
they are said to defy.
The temptation to romanticize Herculine’s sexuality as the utopian
play of pleasures prior to the imposition and restrictions of “sex” surely ought to be refused. It still remains possible, however, to ask the
alternative Foucaultian question: What social practices and conventions produce sexuality in this form? In pursuing the question, we
have, I think, the opportunity to understand something about (a) the
productive capacity of power—that is, the way in which regulative
strategies produce the subjects they come to subjugate; and (b) the
specific mechanism by which power produces sexuality in the context
of this autobiographical narrative. The question of sexual difference
reemerges in a new light when we dispense with the metaphysical
reification of multiplicitous sexuality and inquire in the case of
Herculine into the concrete narrative structures and political and cultural conventions that produce and regulate the tender kisses, the diffuse pleasures, and the thwarted and transgressive thrills of
Herculine’s sexual world.
Among the various matrices of power that produce sexuality
between Herculine and h/er partners are, clearly, the conventions of
female homosexuality both encouraged and condemned by the convent and its supporting religious ideology. One thing about Herculine
~
we know is that s/he reads, and reads a good deal, that h/er nineteenthcentury French education involved schooling in the classics as well as
French Romanticism, and that h/er own narrative takes place within
an established set of literary conventions. Indeed, these conventions
produce and interpret for us this sexuality that both Foucault and
Herculine take to be outside of all convention. Romantic and sentimental narratives of impossible loves seem also to produce all manner
of desire and suffering in this text, and so do Christian legends about
ill-fated saints, Greek myths about suicidal androgynes, and, obviously,
the Christ figure itself. Whether “before” the law as a<a name="b-30"></a> multiplicitous
sexuality or “outside” the law as an unnatural transgression, those positionings are invariably “inside” a discourse which produces sexuality
and then conceals that production through a configuring of a courageous and rebellious sexuality “outside” of the text itself.
The effort to explain Herculine’s sexual relations with young
girls through recourse to the masculine component of h/er biological
doubleness is, of course, the constant temptation of the text. If
Herculine desires a girl, then perhaps there is evidence in hormonal or
chromosomal structures or in the anatomical presence of the imperforate penis to suggest a more discrete, masculine sex that subsequently
generates heterosexual capacity and desire.The pleasures, the desires,
the acts—do they not in some sense emanate from the biological body,
and is there not some way of understanding that emanation as both
causally necessitated by that body and expressive of its sex-specificity?
Perhaps because Herculine’s body is hermaphroditic, the struggle
to separate conceptually the description of h/er primary sexual characteristics from h/er gender identity (h/er sense of h/er own gender
which, by the way, is ever-shifting and far from clear) and the directionality and objects of h/er desire is especially difficult. S/he herself
presumes at various points that h/er body is the cause of h/er gender
confusion and h/er transgressive pleasures, as if they were both result
and manifestation of an essence which somehow falls outside the natural/metaphysical order of things. But rather than understand h/er
~
</span><span class="c-2">anomalous body as the cause of h/er desire, h/er trouble, h/er affairs
and confession, we might read this body, here fully textualized, as a
sign of an irresolvable ambivalence produced by the juridical discourse
on univocal sex. In the </span><span class="c-3">place of univocity, we fail to discover multiplicity,</span><span class="c-1"> as Foucault would have us do; </span><span class="c-3">instead, we confront a fatal ambivalence, produced by the prohibitive law,</span><span class="c-1"> which for all its effects of
happy dispersal nevertheless culminates in Herculine’</span><span class="c-0">s suicide.
If one follows Herculine’s narrative self-exposition, itself a kind of
confessional production of the self, it seems that h/er sexual disposition is one of ambivalence from the outset, that h/er sexuality recapitulates the ambivalent structure of its production, construed in part as
the institutional injunction to pursue the love of the various “sisters”
and “mothers” of the extended convent family and the absolute prohibition against carrying that love too far. Foucault inadvertently suggests that Herculine’s “happy limbo of a non-identity” was made
possible by an historically specific formation of sexuality, namely, “her
sequestered existence among the almost exclusive company of
women.” This “strange happiness,” as he describes it, was at once
“obligatory and forbidden” within the confines of convent conventions. His clear suggestion here is that this homosexual environment,
structured as it is by an eroticized taboo, was one in which this “happy
limbo of a non-identity” is subtly promoted. Foucault then swiftly
retracts the suggestion of Herculine as participating in a practice of
female homosexual conventions, insisting that “non-identity” rather
than a variety of female identities is at play. For Herculine to occupy
the discursive position of “the female homosexual” would be for
Foucault to engage the category of sex—precisely what Foucault
wants Herculine’s narrative to persuade us to reject.
But perhaps Foucault does want to have it both ways; indeed, he
wants implicitly to suggest that nonidentity is what is produced in
homosexual contexts—namely, that homosexuality is instrumental to
the overthrow of the category of sex. Note in Foucault’s following
description of Herculine’s pleasures how the category of sex is at once
~
invoked and refused: The school and the convent “foster the tender
pleasures that sexual nonidentity discovers and provokes when it goes
astray in the midst of all those bodies that are similar to one another”
(xiv). Here Foucault assumes that the likenesses of these bodies condition the happy limbo of their nonidentity, a difficult formulation to
accept both logically and historically, but also as an adequate description of Herculine. Is it the awareness of their likeness that conditions
the sexual play of the young women in the convent, or is it, rather, the
eroticized presence of the law forbidding homosexuality that produces
these transgressive pleasures in the compulsory mode of a confessional? Herculine maintains h/er own discourse of sexual difference even
within this ostensibly homosexual context: s/he notes and enjoys h/er
difference from the young women s/he desires, and yet this difference
is not a simple reproduction of the heterosexual matrix for desire.
S/he knows that her position in that exchange is transgressive, that she
is a “usurper” of a masculine prerogative, as s/he puts it, and that s/he
contests that privilege even as s/he replicates it.
The language of usurpation suggests a participation in the very categories from which s/he feels inevitably distanced, suggesting also the
denaturalized and fluid possibilities of such categories once they are no
longer linked causally or expressively to the presumed fixity of sex.
</span><span class="c-1">Herculine’s anatomy does not fall outside the categories of sex,</span><span class="c-0"> but
confuses and redistributes the constitutive elements of </span><span class="c-1">those categories; indeed, the free play of attributes has the effect of exposing
the illusory character of sex as an abiding substantive substrate to
which these various attributes are </span><span class="c-0">presumed to adhere. </span><span class="c-1">Moreover,
Herculine’s sexuality constitutes a set of gender transgressions which
challenge the very distinction between heterosexual and lesbian erotic
exchange, underscoring the points of their ambiguous convergence
and redistribution.</span><span class="c-0">
But it seems we are compelled to ask, is there not, even at the level
of a discursively constituted sexual ambiguity, some questions of “sex”
and, indeed, of its relation to “power” that set limits on the free play of
~
sexual categories? In other words, how free is that play, whether conceived as a prediscursive libidinal multiplicity or as a discursively constituted multiplicity? Foucault’s original objection to the category of
sex is that it imposes the artifice of unity and univocity on a set of ontologically disparate sexual functions and elements. In an almost
Rousseauian move, Foucault constructs the binary of an artificial cultural law that reduces and distorts what we might well understand as a
natural heterogeneity. Herculine h/erself refers to h/er sexuality as
“this incessant struggle of nature against reason” (103).A cursory examination of these disparate “elements,” however, suggests their thorough
medicalization as “functions,” “sensations,” even “drives.” Hence, the
heterogeneity to which Foucault appeals is itself constituted by the very
medical discourse that he positions as the repressive juridical law. But
what is this heterogeneity that Foucault seems to prize, and what purpose does it serve?
If Foucault contends that sexual nonidentity is promoted in homosexual contexts, he would seem to identify heterosexual contexts as
precisely those in which identity is constituted. We know already that
he understands the category of sex and of identity generally to be the
effect and instrument of a regulatory sexual regime, but it is less clear
whether that regulation is reproductive or heterosexual, or something
else. Does that regulation of sexuality produce male and female identities within a symmetrical binary relation? If homosexuality produces
sexual nonidentity, then homosexuality itself no longer relies on identities being like one another; indeed, homosexuality could no longer be
described as such. But if homosexuality is meant to designate the place
of an unnameable libidinal heterogeneity, perhaps we can ask whether
this is, instead, a love that either cannot or dare not speak its name? In
other words, Foucault, who gave only one interview on homosexuality
and has always resisted the confessional moment in his own work, nevertheless presents Herculine’s confession to us in an unabashedly
didactic mode. Is this a displaced confession that presumes a continuity
or parallel between his life and hers?
~
On the cover of the French edition, he remarks that Plutarch
understood illustrious persons to constitute parallel lives which in some
sense travel infinite lines that eventually meet in eternity. He remarks
that there are some lives that veer off the track of infinity and threaten
to disappear into an obscurity that can never be recovered—lives that
do not follow the “straight” path, as it were, into an eternal community
of greatness, but deviate and threaten to become fully irrecoverable.
“That would be the inverse of Plutarch,” he writes, “lives at parallel
points that nothing can bring back together” (my translation). Here the
textual reference is most clearly to the separation of Herculine, the
adopted male name (though with a curiously feminine ending), and
Alexina, the name that designated Herculine in the female mode. But it
is also a reference to Herculine and Sara, h/er lover, who are quite literally separated and whose paths quite obviously diverge. But perhaps
Herculine is in some sense also parallel to Foucault, parallel precisely in
the sense in which divergent lifelines, which are in no sense “straight,”
might well be. Indeed, perhaps Herculine and Foucault are parallel, not
in any literal sense, but in their very contestation of the literal as such,
especially as it applies to the categories of sex.
Foucault’s suggestion in the preface that there are bodies which are
in some sense “similar” to each other disregards the hermaphroditic
distinctness of Herculine’s body, as well as h/er own presentation of
h/erself as very much unlike the women s/he desires. Indeed, after
some manner of sexual exchange, Herculine engages the language of
appropriation and triumph, avowing Sara as her eternal property when
she remarks, “From that moment on, Sara belonged to me . . . !!!”
(51). So why would Foucault resist the very text that he wants to use in
order to make such a claim? In the one interview Foucault gave on
homosexuality, James O’Higgins, the interviewer, remarks that “there
is a growing tendency in American intellectual circles, particularly
among radical feminists, to distinguish between male and female
homosexuality,” a position, he argues, that claims that very different
~
bians tend to prefer monogamy and the like while gay men generally
do not. Foucault responds by laughing, suggested by the bracketed
“[Laughs],” and he says, “All I can do is explode with laughter.”19 This
explosive laughter, we may remember, also followed Foucault’s reading of Borges, reported in the preface to The Or<a name="b-31"></a>der of Things (Les mots et
les choses):
This book first arose out of a passage in Borges, out of the laughter
that shattered, as I read the passage, all the familiar landmarks of my
thought . . . </span><span class="c-1">breaking up all the ordered surfaces and all the planes
with which we are accustomed </span><span class="c-0">to tame the wild profusion of existing
things, and continuing long afterwards to disturb and threaten with
collapse our age-old distinction between the Same and the Other.20

The passage is, of course, from the Chinese encyclopedia which confounds the Aristotelian distinction between universal categories and
particular instances. But there is also the “shattering laughter” of Pierre
Rivière whose murderous destruction of his family, or, perhaps, for
Foucault, of the family, seems quite literally to negate the categories of
kinship and, by extension, of sex.21 And there is, of course, Bataille’s
now famous laughter which, Derrida tells us in Writing and Difference,
designates that excess that escapes the conceptual mastery of Hegel’s
dialectic.22 Foucault, then, seems to laugh precisely because the question instates the very binary that he seeks to displace, that dreary binary of Same and Other that has plagued not only the legacy of dialectics,
but the dialectic of sex as well. But then there is, of course, the laugh
of Medusa, which, Hélène Cixous tells us, shatters the placid surface
constituted by the petrifying gaze and which exposes the dialectic of
Same and Other as taking place through the axis of sexual difference.23
In a gesture that resonates self-consciously with the tale of Medusa,
Herculine h/erself writes of “the cold fixity of my gaze [that] seems to
freeze” (105) those who encounter it.
But it is, of course, Irigaray who exposes this dialectic of Same and
Other as a false binary, the illusion of a symmetrical difference which
~
consolidates the metaphysical economy of phallogocentrism, the economy of the same. In her view, the Other as well as the Same are marked
as masculine; the Other is but the negative elaboration of the masculine subject with the result that the female sex is unrepresentable—
that is, it is the sex which, within this signifying economy, is not one.
But it is not one also in the sense that it eludes the univocal signification characteristic of the Symbolic, and because it is not a substantive
identity, but always and only an undetermined relation of difference to
the economy which renders it absent. It is not “one” in the sense that it
is multiple and diffuse in its pleasures and its signifying mode. Indeed,
perhaps Herculine’s apparently multiplicitous pleasures would qualify
for the mark of the feminine in its polyvalence and in its refusal to submit to the reductive efforts of univocal signification.
But let us not forget Herculine’s relation to the laugh which seems
to appear twice, first in the fear of being laughed at (23) and later as a
laugh of scorn that s/he directs against the doctor, for whom s/he
loses respect after he fails to tell the appropriate authorities of the natural irregularity that has been revealed to him (71). For Herculine,
then, laughter appears to designate either humiliation or scorn, two
positions unambiguously related to a damning law, subjected to it
either as its instrument or object. Herculine does not fall outside the
jurisdiction of that law; even h/er exile is understood on the model of
punishment. On the very first page, s/he reports that h/er “place was
not marked out [pas marquée] in this world that shunned me.” And s/he
articulates the early sense of abjection that is later enacted first as a
devoted daughter or lover to be likened to a “dog” or a “slave” and then
finally in a full and fatal form as s/he is expelled and expels h/erself
from the domain of all human beings. From this presuicidal isolation,
s/he claims to soar above both sexes, but h/er anger is most fully
directed against men, whose “title” s/he sought to usurp in h/er intimacy with Sara and whom s/he now indicts without restraint as those
who somehow forbid h/er the possibility of love.
At the beginning of the narrative, s/he offers two one-sentence
~
paragraphs “parallel” to one another which suggest a melancholic
incorporation of the lost father, a postponement of the anger of abandonment through the structural instatement of that negativity into
h/er identity and desire. Before s/he tells us that s/he h/erself was
abandoned by h/er mother quickly and without advance notice, s/he
tells us that for reasons unstated s/he spent a few years in a house for
abandoned and orphaned children. S/he refers to the “poor creatures,
deprived from their cradle of a mother’s love.” In the next sentence
s/he refers to this institution as a “refuge [asile] of suffering and affliction,” and in the following sentence refers to h/er father “whom a
sudden death tore away . . . from the tender affection of my mother”
(4). Although h/er own abandonment is twice deflected here through
the pity for others who are suddenly rendered motherless, s/he establishes an identification through that deflection, one that later reappears
as the joint plight of father and daughter cut off from the maternal
caress. The deflections of desire are semantically compounded, as it
were, as Herculine proceeds to fall in love with “mother” after “mother” and then falls in love with various mothers’ “daughters,” which
scandalizes all manner of mother. Indeed, s/he vacillates between
being the object of everyone’s adoration and excitement and an object
of scorn and abandonment, the split consequence of a melancholic
structure left to feed on itself without intervention. If melancholy
involves self-recrimination, as Freud argues, and if that recrimination
is a kind of negative narcissism (attending to the self, even if only in the
mode of berating that self), then Herculine can be understood to be
constantly falling into the opposition between negative and positive
narcissism, at once avowing h/erself as the most abandoned and
neglected creature on earth but also as the one who casts a spell of
enchantment on everyone who comes near h/er, indeed, one who is
better for all women than any “man” (107).
S/he refers to the hospital for orphaned children as that early
“refuge of suffering,” an abode that s/he figuratively reencounters at
the close of the narrative as the “refuge of the tomb.” Just as that early
~
refuge provides a magical communion and identification with the
phantom father, so the tomb of death is already occupied by the very
father whom s/he hopes death will let h/er meet: “The sight of the
tomb reconciles me to life,” she writes. “It makes me feel an indefinable tenderness for the one whose bones are lying there beneath my
feet [là à mes pieds]” (109). But this love, formulated as a kind of solidarity against the abandoning mother, is itself in no way purified of the
anger of abandonment: The father “beneath [h/er] feet” is earlier
enlarged to become the totality of men over whom s/he soars, and
whom s/he claims to dominate (107), and toward whom s/he directs
h/er laugh of disdain. Earlier s/he remarks about the doctor who discovered h/er anomalous condition, “I wished he were a hundred feet
underground!” (69).
Herculine’s ambivalence here implies the limits of Foucault’s theory of the “happy limbo of a non-identity.” Almost prefiguring the place
Herculine will assume for Foucault, s/he wonders whether s/he is not
“the plaything of an impossible dream” (79). Herculine’s sexual disposition is one of ambivalence from the outset, and, as argued earlier,
h/er sexuality recapitulates the ambivalent structure of its production,
construed in part as the institutional injunction to pursue the love of
the various “sisters” and “mothers” of the extended convent family and
the absolute prohibition against carrying that love too far. H/er sexuality is not outside the law, but is the ambivalent production of the law,
one in which the very notion of prohibition spans the psychoanalytic
and institutional terrains. H/er confessions, as well as h/er desires, are
subjection and defiance at once. In other words, the love prohibited by
death or abandonment, or both, is a love that takes prohibition to be its
condition and its aim.
After submitting to the law, Herculine becomes a juridically sanctioned subject as a “man,” and yet the gender category proves less fluid
than h/er own references to Ovid’s Metamorphoses suggest. H/er heteroglossic discourse challenges the viability of the notion of a “person”
who might be said to preexist gender or exchange one gender for the
~
other. If s/he is not actively condemned by others, s/he condemns
h/erself (even calls h/erself a “judge” [106]), revealing that the juridical law in effect is much greater than the empirical law that effects
h/er gender conversion. Indeed, Herculine can never embody that law
precisely because s/he cannot provide the occasion by which that law
naturalizes itself in the symbolic structures of anatomy. In other
words, the law is not simply a cultural imposition on an otherwise natural heterogeneity; the law requires conformity to its own notion of
“nature” and gains its legitimacy through the binary and asymmetrical
naturalization of bodies in which the Phallus, though clearly not identical with the penis, nevertheless deploys the penis as its naturalized
instrument and sign.
Herculine’s pleasures and desires are in no way the bucolic innocence that thrives and proliferates prior to the imposition of a juridical
law. Neither does s/he fully fall outside the signifying economy of </span><span class="c-1">masculinity. S/he is “outside” the law, but the law maintains this “outside”
within </span><span class="c-0">itself. In effect, s/he embodies the law, not as an entitled subject, but as an enacted testimony to the law’s uncanny capacity to produce only those rebellions that it can guarantee will—out of
fidelity—defeat themselves and those subjects who, utterly subjected,
have no choice but to reiterate the law of their genesis.
Concluding Unscientific Postscript
Within The History of Sexuality,Volume I, Foucault appears to locate the
quest for identity within the context of juridical forms of power that
become fully articulate with the advent of the sexual sciences, including psychoanalysis, toward the end of the nineteenth century. Although
Foucault revised his historiography of sex at the outset of The Use of
Pleasure (L’Usage des plaisirs) and sought to discover the repressive/generative rules of subject-formation in early Greek and Roman texts, his
philosophical project to expose the regulatory production of identityeffects remained constant. A contemporary example of this quest for
~
ple that inadvertently confirms the continuing applicability of a
Foucaultian critique.
One place to interrogate the univocity of sex is the recent controversy over the master gene that researchers at MIT in late 19<a name="b-32"></a>87 claim
to have discovered as the secret and certain determinant of sex. With
the use of highly sophisticated technological means, the master gene,
which constitutes a specific DNA sequence on the Y chromosome, was
discovered by Dr. David Page and his colleagues and named “TDF” or
testis-determining factor. In the publication of his findings in Cell (No.
51), Dr. Page claimed to have discovered “the binary switch upon
which hinges all sexually dimorphic characteristics.”24 Let us then consider the claims of this discovery and see why the unsettling questions
regarding the decidability of sex continue to be asked.
According to Page’s article, “The Sex-Determining Region of the
Human Y Chromosome Encodes a Finger Protein,” samples of DNA
were taken from a highly unusual group of people, some of whom had
XX chromosomes, but had been medically designated as males, and
some of whom had XY chromosomal constitution, but had been medically designated as female. He does not tell us exactly on what basis
they had been designated contrary to the chromosomal findings, but
we are left to presume that obvious primary and secondary characteristics suggested that those were, indeed, the appropriate designations.
Page and his coworkers made the following hypothesis:There must be
some stretch of DNA, which cannot be seen under the usual microscopic conditions, that determines the male sex, and this stretch of
DNA must have been moved somehow from the Y chromosome, its
usual location, to some other chromosome, where one would not
expect to find it. Only if we could presume (a) this undetectable DNA
sequence and (b) prove its translocatability, could we understand why
it is that an XX male had no detectable Y chromosome, but was, in fact,
still male. Similarly, we could explain the curious presence of the Y
chromosome on females precisely because that stretch of DNA had
somehow been misplaced.
~
Although the pool that Page and his researchers used to come up
with this finding was limited, the speculation on which they base their
research, in part, is that a good ten percent of the population has
chromosomal variations that do not fit neatly into the XX-female
and XY-male set of categories. Hence, the discovery of the “mastergene” is considered to be a more certain basis for understanding sexdetermination and, hence, sex-difference, than previous chromosomal
criteria could provide.
Unfortunately for Page, there was one persistent problem that
haunted the claims made on behalf of the discovery of the DNA
sequence. Exactly the same stretch of DNA said to determine maleness was, in fact, found to be present on the X chromosomes of
females. Page first responded to this curious discovery by claiming that
perhaps it was not the presence of the gene sequence in males versus its
absence in females that was determining, but that it was active in males
and passive in females (Aristotle lives!). But this suggestion remains
hypothetical and, according to Anne Fausto-Sterling, Page and his
coworkers failed to mention in that Cell article that the individuals
from whom the gene samples were taken were far from unambiguous
in their anatomical and reproductive constitutions. I quote from her
article, “Life in the XY Corral”:
the four XX males whom they studied were all sterile (no sperm
production), had small testes which totally lacked germ cells, i.e.,
precursor cells for sperms. They also had high hormone levels and
low testosterone levels. Presumably they were classified as males
because of their external genitalia and the presence of testes. . . .
Similarly . . . both of the XY females’ external genitalia were normal,
[but] their ovaries lacked germ cells. (328)

Clearly these are cases in which the component parts of sex do not
add up to the recognizable coherence or unity that is usually designated
by the category of sex. This incoherence troubles Page’s argument as
well, for it is unclear why we should agree at the outset that these are
~
XX-males and XY-females, when it is precisely the designation of male
and female that is under question and that is implicitly already decided
by the recourse to external genitalia. Indeed, if external genitalia were
sufficient as a criterion by which to determine or assign sex, then the
experimental research into the master gene would hardly be necessary
at all.
But consider a different kind of problem with the way in which
that particular hypothesis is formulated, tested, and validated. Notice
that Page and his coworkers conflate sex-determination with maledetermination, and with testis-determination. Geneticists Eva Eicher
and Linda L. Washburn in the Annual Review of Genetics suggest that
ovary-determination is never considered in the literature on sexdetermination and that femaleness is always conceptualized in terms of
the absence of the male-determining factor or of the passive presence
of that factor. As absent or passive, it is definitionally disqualified as an
object of study. Eicher and Washburn suggest, however, that it is active
and that a cultural prejudice, indeed, a set of gendered assumptions
about sex, and about what might make such an inquiry valuable, skew
and limit the research into sex-determination. Fausto-Sterling quotes
Eicher and Washburn:
Some investigators have overemphasized the hypothesis that the Y
chromosome is involved in testis-determination by presenting the
induction of testicular tissue as an active, (gene-directed, dominant)
event while presenting the induction of ovarian tissue as a passive
(automatic) event. Certainly, the induction of ovarian tissue is as
much an active, genetically directed developmental process as the
induction of testicular tissue, or for that matter, the induction of any
cellular differentiation process. Almost nothing has been written
about genes involved in the induction of ovarian tissue from the
undifferentiated gonad. (325)

In related fashion, the entire field of embryology has come under
~
tiation. Feminist critics of the field of molecular cell biology have
argued against its nucleocentric assumptions. As opposed to a research
orientation that seeks to establish the nucleus of a fully differentiated
cell as the master or director of the development of a complete and
well-formed new organism, a research program is suggested that
would reconceive the nucleus as something which gains its meaning
and control only within its cellular context. According to FaustoSterling, “the question to ask is not how a cell nucleus changes during
differentiation, but, rather, how the dynamic nuclear-cytoplasmic
interactions alter during differentation” (323–24).
The structure of Page’s inquiry fits squarely within the general
trends of molecular cell biology.The framework suggests a refusal from
the outset to consider that these individuals implicitly challenge the
descriptive force of the available categories of sex; the question he pursues is that of how the “binary switch” gets started, not whether the
description of bodies in terms of binary sex is adequate to the task at
hand. Moreover, the concentration on the “master gene” suggests that
femaleness ought to be understood as the presence or absence
of maleness or, at best, the presence of a passivity that, in men, would
invariably be active. This claim is, of course, made within the research context in which active ovarian contributions to sex differentiation have never been strongly considered. The conclusion here is
not that valid and demonstrable claims cannot be made about sexdetermination, but rather that cultural assumptions regarding the relative status of men and women and the binary relation of gender itself
frame and focus the research into sex-determination.The task of distinguishing sex from gender becomes all the more difficult once we understand that gendered meanings frame the hypothesis and the reasoning of
those biomedical inquiries that seek to establish “sex” for us as it is prior
to the cultural meanings that it acquires. Indeed, the task is even more
complicated when we realize that the language of biology participates
in other kinds of languages and </span><span class="c-2">reproduces that cultural sedimentation
in the objects it purports to discover and neutrally describe.</span><span class="c-0">
~
Is it not a purely cultural convention to which Page and others refer
when they decide that an anatomically ambiguous XX individual is
male, a convention that takes genitalia to be the definitive “sign” of sex?
One might argue that the discontinuities in these instances cannot be
resolved through recourse to a single determinant and that sex, as a category that comprises a variety of elements, functions, and chromosomal and hormonal dimensions, no longer operates within the binary
framework that we take for granted. The point here is not to seek
recourse to the exceptions, the bizarre, in order merely to relativize the
claims made in behalf of normal sexual life. As Freud suggests in Three
Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, however, it is the exception, the strange,
that gives us the clue to how the mundane and taken-for-granted world
of sexual meanings is constituted. Only from a self-consciously denaturalized position can we see how the appearance of naturalness is itself
constituted. The </span><span class="c-2">presuppositions that we make about sexed bodies,
about them being one or the other, about the meanings that are said to
inhere in them or to follow from being sexed in such a way are suddenly and significantly upset by those examples that fail to comply with the
categories that naturalize and stabilize that field of bodies for us within
the terms of cultural conventions.</span><span class="c-0"> Hence, the strange, the incoherent,
that which falls “outside,” gives us a way of understanding the taken-forgranted </span><span class="c-1">world of sexual categorization as a constructed one, indeed, as
one that might well be constructed differently.</span><span class="c-0">
Although we may not immediately agree with the analysis that
Foucault supplies—namely, that the category of sex is constructed in
the service of a system of regulatory and reproductive sexuality—it is
interesting to note that Page designates the external genitalia, those
anatomical parts essential to the symbolization of reproductive sexuality, as the unambiguous and a priori determinants of sex assignment.
One might well argue that Page’s inquiry is beset by two discourses
that, in this instance, conflict: the cultural discourse that takes external
genitalia to be the sure signs of sex, and does that in the service of
reproductive interests, and the discourse that seeks to establish the
~
male principle as active and monocausal, if not autogenetic.The desire
to determine sex once and for all, and to determine it as one sex rather
than the other, thus seems to issue from the </span><span class="c-1">social organization of sexual reproduction through the construction of the clear and unequivocal identities and positions of sexed bodies with respect<a name="b-33"></a> to each other.</span><span class="c-0">
Because within the framework of reproductive sexuality the male
body is usually figured as the active agent, the problem with Page’s
inquiry is, in a sense, to reconcile the discourse of reproduction with
the discourse of masculine activity, two discourses that usually work
together culturally, but in this instance have come apart. Interesting,
then, is Page’s willingness to settle on the active DNA sequence as the
last word, in effect giving the principle of masculine activity priority
over the discourse of reproduction.
This priority, however, would constitute only an appearance,
according to the theory of Monique Wittig. The category of sex belongs to a system of compulsory heterosexuality that clearly operates
through a system of compulsory sexual reproduction. In Wittig’s view,
to which we now turn, “masculine” and “feminine,” “male” and “female”
exist only within the heterosexual matrix; indeed, they are the naturalized terms that keep that matrix concealed and, hence, protected from
a radical critique.
iii. Monique Wittig: Bodily Disintegration and
Fictive Sex
</span><span class="c-4">Language casts sheaves of reality upon the social body.</span><span class="c-0">
—Monique Wittig

Simone de Beauvoir wrote in The Second Sex that “one is not born a
woman, but rather becomes one.” The phrase is odd, even nonsensical,
for how can one become a woman if one wasn’t a woman all along?
And who is this “one” who does the becoming? Is there some human
who becomes its gender at some point in time? Is it fair to assume that
this human was not its gender before it became its gender? How does
one “become” a gender? What is the moment or mechanism of gender
~
construction? And, perhaps most pertinently, when does this mechanism arrive on the cultural scene to transform the human subject into
a gendered subject?
Are there ever humans who are not, as it were, always already gendered? The mark of gender appears to “qualify” bodies as human bodies; the </span><span class="c-1">moment in which an infant becomes humanized is when the
question, “is it a boy or girl?” is answered. Those bodily figures who
do not fit into either gender fall outside the human, indeed, constitute
the domain of the dehumanized and the abject against which the
human itself is constituted.</span><span class="c-0"> If gender is always there, delimiting in
advance what qualifies as the human, how can we speak of a human
who becomes its gender, as if gender were a postscript or a cultural
afterthought?
Beauvoir, of course, meant merely to suggest that the category of
women is a variable cultural accomplishment, a set of meanings that are
taken on or taken up within a cultural field, and that no one is born with
a gender—gender is always acquired. On the other hand, </span><span class="c-1">Beauvoir was
willing to affirm that one is born with a sex, as a sex, sexed, and that
being sexed and being human are coextensive and simultaneous; sex is
an analytic attribute of the human; there is no human who is not sexed;
sex qualifies the human as a necessary attribute. But sex does not cause
gender, and gender cannot be understood to reflect or express sex;
indeed, for Beauvoir, sex is immutably factic, but gender acquired, and
whereas sex cannot be changed—or so she thought—gender is the
variable cultural construction of sex,</span><span class="c-0"> the myriad and open possibilities
of cultural meaning occasioned by a sexed body.
Beauvoir’s theory implied seemingly radical consequences, ones
that she herself did not entertain. For instance, if sex and gender are
radically </span><span class="c-1">distinct, then it does not follow that to be a given sex is to
become a given gender;</span><span class="c-0"> in other words, “woman” need not be the cultural construction of the female body, and “man” need not interpret
male bodies. This radical formulation of the sex/gender distinction
~
ent genders, and further, that gender itself need not be restricted to
the usual two. If sex does not limit gender, then perhaps there are genders, ways of culturally interpreting the sexed body, that are in no way
restricted by the apparent duality of sex. </span><span class="c-1">Consider the further consequence that if gender is something that one becomes—but can never
be—then </span><span class="c-2">gender is itself a kind of becoming or activity, and that </span><span class="c-3">gender ought not to be conceived as a </span><span class="c-5">noun or a substantial thing or a static cultural marker, but rather as an incessant and repeated action of
some </span><span class="c-3">sort.</span><span class="c-0"> If </span><span class="c-2">gender is not tied to sex, either causally or expressively,
then gender is a kind of action that can potentially </span><span class="c-3">proliferate beyond
the binary limits imposed by the apparent binary of sex.</span><span class="c-1"> Indeed, gender would be a </span><span class="c-2">kind of cultural/corporeal action that requires a new
vocabulary </span><span class="c-1">that institutes and proliferates present participles of various kinds, resignifiable and expansive categories that resist both the
binary and substantializing grammatical restrictions on gender.</span><span class="c-0"> But
how would such a project become culturally conceivable and avoid the
fate of an impossible and vain utopian project?
“One is not born a woman.” Monique Wittig echoed that phrase in
an article by the same name, published in Feminist Issues (1:1). But what
sort of echo and re-presentation of Beauvoir does Monique Wittig
offer? Two of her claims both recall Beauvoir and set Wittig apart from
her: one, that the category of sex is neither invariant nor natural, but is
a specifically political use of the category of nature that serves the purposes of reproductive sexuality. In other words, there is no reason to
divide up human bodies into male and female sexes except that such a
division suits the economic needs of heterosexuality and lends a naturalistic gloss to the institution of heterosexuality. Hence, for Wittig,
there is no distinction between sex and gender; the category of “sex” is
itself a gendered category, fully politically invested, naturalized but not
natural.The second rather counter-intuitive claim that Wittig makes is
the following: a lesbian is not a woman. A woman, she argues, only
exists as a term that stabilizes and consolidates a binary and oppositional relation to a man; that relation, she argues, is heterosexuality. A
~
lesbian, she claims, in refusing heterosexuality is no longer defined in
terms of that oppositional relation. Indeed, a lesbian, she maintains,
transcends the binary opposition between woman and man; a lesbian is
neither a woman nor a man. But further, a lesbian has no sex; she is
beyond the categories of sex.Through the lesbian refusal of those categories, the lesbian exposes (pronouns are a problem here) the contingent cultural constitution of those categories and the tacit yet abiding
presumption of the heterosexual matrix. Hence, for Wittig, we might
say, one is not born a woman, one becomes one; but further, one is not
born female, one becomes female; but even more radically, one can, if
one chooses, become neither female nor male, woman nor man.
Indeed, the lesbian appears to be a third gender or, as I shall show, a
category that radically problematizes both sex and gender as stable
political categories of description.
Wittig argues that the linguistic discrimination of “sex” secures the
political and cultural operation of compulsory heterosexuality. This
relation of heterosexuality, she argues, is neither reciprocal nor binary
in the usual sense; “sex” is always already female, and there is only one
sex, the feminine. To be male is not to be “sexed”; to be “sexed” is
always a way of becoming particular and relative, and males within this
system participate in the form of the universal person. For Wittig,
then, the “female sex” does not imply some other sex, as in a “male
sex”; the “female sex” implies only itself, enmeshed, as it were, in sex,
trapped in what Beauvoir called the circle of immanence. Because
“sex” is a political and cultural interpretation of the body, </span><span class="c-1">there is no
sex/gender distinction along conventional lines; gender is built into
sex, and sex proves to have been gender from the start.</span><span class="c-0"> Wittig argues
that within this set of compulsory social relations, women become
ontologically suffused with sex; they are their sex, and, conversely, sex
is necessarily feminine.
Wittig understands “sex” to be discursively produced and circulated by a system of significations oppressive to women, gays, and lesbians. She refuses to take part in this signifying system or to believe in
~
the viability of taking up a reformist or subversive position within the
system; to invoke a part of it is to invoke and confirm the entirety of it.
As a result, the political task she formulates is to overthrow the entire
discourse on sex, indeed, to overthrow the very grammar that institutes “gender”—or “fictive sex”—as an essential attribute of humans
and objects alike (especially pronounced in French).25 Through her
theory and fiction she calls for a radical reorganization of the description of bodies and sexualities without recourse to sex and, consequently, without recourse to the pronomial differentiations that
regulate and distribute rights of speech within the matrix of gender.
Wittig understands discursive categories like “sex” as abstractions
forcibly imposed upon the social field, ones that produce a secondorder or reified “reality.” Although it appears that individuals have a
“direct perception” of sex, taken as an objective datum of experience,
Wittig argues that such an object has been violently shaped into such a
datum and that the history and mechanism of that violent shaping no
longer appears with that object.26 Hence, “sex” is the reality-effect of a
violent process that is concealed by that very effect. All that appears is
“sex,” and so “sex” is perceived to be the totality of what is, uncaused,
but only because the cause is nowhere to be seen. Wittig realizes that
her position is counterintuitive, but the political cultivation of intuition is precisely what she wants to elucidate, expose, and challenge:
Sex is </span><span class="c-1">taken as an “immediate given,” “a sensible given,” “physical
features,” belonging to a natural order. But what we </span><span class="c-3">believe to be a
physical and direct perception is only a sophisticated and mythic
construction, an “imaginary formation,” which reinterprets physical features (in themselves as neutral as others but marked by a social
system), through the network of relationships in which they are
perceived.</span><span class="c-0">27

“Physical features” appear to be in some sense there on the far side
of language, unmarked by a social system. It is unclear, however, that
these features could be named in a way that would not reproduce the
~
reductive operation of the categories of sex. These numerous features
gain social meaning and unification through their articulation within
the category of sex. In other words, “sex” imposes an artificial unity on
an otherwise discontinuous set of attributes. As both discursive and perceptual, “sex” denotes an historically contingent epistemic regime, a
language that forms perception by forcibly shaping the interrelationships through which phy<a name="b-34"></a>sical bodies are perceived.
Is there a “physical” </span><span class="c-2">body prior to the perceptually perceived body?
An impossible question to decide.</span><span class="c-0"> Not only is the </span><span class="c-1">gathering of attributes under the category of sex suspect, but so is the very discrimination of the “features” themselves. That penis, vagina, breasts, and so
forth, are named sexual parts is both a restriction of the erogenous
body to those parts </span><span class="c-0">and a fragmentation of the body as a whole.
Indeed, the “unity” imposed upon the body by the category of sex is a
“disunity,” a fragmentation and compartmentalization, and a reduction
of erotogeneity. No wonder, then, that Wittig textually enacts the
“overthrow” of the category of sex through a destruction and fragmentation of the sexed body in The Lesbian Body. As “sex” fragments the
body, so the </span><span class="c-1">lesbian overthrow of “sex” targets as models of domination
those sexually differentiated norms of bodily integrity that dictate
what “unifies” and renders coherent the body as a sexed </span><span class="c-0">body. In her
theory and fiction, Wittig shows that the “integrity” and “unity” of the
body, often thought to be positive ideals, serve the purposes of fragmentation, restriction, and domination.
</span><span class="c-1">Language gains the power to create “the socially real” through the
locutionary acts of speaking subjects. There appear to be two levels of
reality, two orders of ontology, in Wittig’s theory. Socially constituted
ontology emerges from a more fundamental ontology that appears </span><span class="c-0">to
be pre-social and pre-</span><span class="c-1">discursive.Whereas “sex” belongs to a discursively constituted reality (second-order), there is a pre-social ontology
that accounts for the constitution of the discursive itself. She clearly
refuses the structuralist assumption of a set of universal signifying
structures prior to the speaking subject that orchestrate the formation
~
of that subject and his or her speech. In her view, there are historically
contingent structures characterized </span><span class="c-0">as heterosexual and </span><span class="c-1">compulsory
that distribute the rights of full and authoritative speech to males and
deny them to females. But this socially constituted asymmetry disguises and violates a pre-social ontology of unified and equal persons.</span><span class="c-0">
The </span><span class="c-1">task for women,Wittig argues, is to assume the position of the
authoritative, speaking subject—which is in some sense their ontologically grounded “right”—and to overthrow both the category of sex
and the system of compulsory heterosexuality that is its origin.</span><span class="c-0">
Language, for Wittig, is a set of acts, repeated over time, that produce
reality-effects that are eventually misperceived as “facts.” Collectively
considered, the repeated practice of naming sexual difference has created this appearance of natural division.The “naming” of sex is an act of
domination and compulsion, an institutionalized performative that
both creates and legislates social reality by requiring the discursive/
perceptual construction of bodies in accord with principles of sexual
difference. Hence, Wittig concludes, “we are </span><span class="c-1">compelled in our bodies
and our minds to correspond, feature by feature, with the idea of
nature that has been established for us </span><span class="c-0">. . .‘men’ and ‘women’ are political categories, and not natural facts.”28
“Sex,” the category, compels “sex,” the social configuration of bodies, through what Wittig calls a coerced contract. Hence, the category
of “sex” is a name that enslaves. </span><span class="c-1">Language “casts sheaves of reality upon
the social body,</span><span class="c-0">” but these sheaves are not easily discarded. She continues: “stamping it and violently shaping it.”29 Wittig argues that the
“straight mind,” evident in the discourses of the human sciences,
“oppress all of us, lesbians, women, and homosexual men” because
they “take for granted that what founds society, any society, is heterosexuality.”30 Discourse becomes oppressive when it requires that the
</span><span class="c-1">speaking subject, in order to speak, participate in the very terms of
that oppression—that is, take for granted the speaking subject’s
own impossibility </span><span class="c-0">or unintelligibility. This presumptive heterosexuality, she argues, functions within discourse to communicate a threat:
~
“‘you-will-be-straight-or-you-will-not-be.’”31 Women, lesbians, and
gay men, she argues, </span><span class="c-3">cannot assume the position of the speaking subject within the linguistic system of compulsory heterosexuality. To
speak within the system is to be deprived of the possibility of speech;
hence, to speak at all in that context is a performative contradiction,
the linguistic assertion of a self that cannot </span><span class="c-1">“be” within the language
that asserts </span><span class="c-0">it.
The power Wittig accords to this “system” of language is enormous.
Concepts, categories, and abstractions, she argues, can effect a physical
and material violence against the bodies they claim to organize and
interpret: “There is nothing abstract about the power that sciences and
theories have to act materially and actually upon our bodies and minds,
even if the discourse that produces it is abstract. It is one of the forms
of domination, its very expression, as Marx said. I would say, rather,
one of its exercises. All of the oppressed know this power and have had
to deal with it.”32 The </span><span class="c-1">power of language to work on bodies is both the
cause of sexual oppression and the way beyond that oppression.
Language </span><span class="c-0">works neither magically nor inexorably: “</span><span class="c-1">there is a plasticity
of the real to language: language has a plastic action upon the real.</span><span class="c-0">”33
</span><span class="c-1">Language assumes and alters its power to act upon the real through
locutionary acts, which, repeated,</span><span class="c-0"> become entrenched practices and,
ultimately, institutions. The asymmetrical structure of language that
identifies the subject who speaks for and as the universal with the male
and identifies the female speaker as “particular” and “interested” is in no
sense intrinsic to particular languages or to language itself.These asymmetrical positions cannot be understood to follow from the “nature” of
men or women, for, as Beauvoir established, no such “nature” exists:
“One </span><span class="c-2">must understand that men are not born with a faculty for the universal and that women are not reduced at birth to the particular. The
universal has been, and is continually, at every moment, appropriated
by men.</span><span class="c-1"> It does not happen, it must be done. It is an act, a criminal act,
perpetrated by one class against another. It is an act carried out at the
level of concepts, philosophy, politics.</span><span class="c-0">”34
~
Although Irigaray argues that “the subject is always already masculine,” Wittig disputes the notion that “the subject” is exclusively masculine territory.The very </span><span class="c-1">plasticity of language, for her, resists the fixing of
the subject position as masculine.</span><span class="c-0"> Indeed, the presumption of an
absolute speaking subject is, for Wittig, the political goal for “women,”
which, if achieved, will effectively dissolve the category of “women”
altogether. A </span><span class="c-2">woman cannot use the first person “I” because as a woman,
the speaker is “particular” (relative, interested, perspectival), and the
invocation of the “I” presumes the capacity to speak for and as the universal human:</span><span class="c-0"> “a </span><span class="c-1">relative subject is inconceivable, a relative subject
could not speak at all.</span><span class="c-0">”35 Relying on the assumption that all speaking
presupposes and implicitly invokes the entirety of language, Wittig
describes the speaking subject as one who, in the act of saying “I,” “reappropriates language as a whole, proceeding from oneself alone, with the
power to use all language.” </span><span class="c-1">This absolute grounding of the speaking “I”
assumes god-like dimensions within Wittig’</span><span class="c-0">s discussion.This privilege to
speak “I” establishes a sovereign self, a center of absolute plenitude and
power; speaking establishes “the supreme act of subjectivity.”This coming into subjectivity is the effective overthrow of sex and, hence, the
feminine: “no </span><span class="c-1">woman can say I without being for herself a total subject—that is, ungendered, universal, whole.</span><span class="c-0">”36
Wittig continues with a startling speculation on the nature of language and “being” that situates her own political project within the traditional discourse of ontotheology. In her view, the primary ontology
of language gives every person the same opportunity to establish subjectivity. The practical task that women face in trying to establish subjectivity through speech depends on their collective ability to cast off
the reifications of sex imposed on them which deform them as partial
or relative beings. Since this discarding follows upon the exercise of a
full invocation of “I,” women speak their way out of their gender. The
social reifications of sex can be understood to mask or distort a prior
ontological reality, that reality being the equal opportunity of all persons, prior to the marking by sex, to exercise language in the assertion
~
of subjectivity. In speaking, the “I” assumes the totality of language and,
hence, speaks potentially from all positions—that is, in a universal
mode. “Gender . . . works upon this ontological fact to annul it,” she
writes, assuming the primary principle of equal access to the universal
to qualify as that “ontological fact.”37 This principle of equal access,
however, is itself grounded in an ontological presumption of the unity
of speaking beings in a Being that is prior to sexed being. Gender, she
argues, “tries to accomplish the division of Being,” but “Being as being
is not divided.”38 Here the coherent assertion of the “I” presupposes
not only the totality of language, but the unity of being.
If nowhere else quite so plainly, Wittig places herself here within
the traditional discourse of the philosophical pursuit of presence,
Being, radical and uninterrupted plenitude. In distinction from a
Derridean position that would understand all signification to rely on
an operational différance, Wittig argues that speaking requires and
invokes a seamless identity of all things. This foundationalist fiction
gives her a point of departure by which to criticize existing social institutions.The critical question remains, however, what contingent social
relations does that presumption of being, authority, and universal subjecthood serve? Why value the usurpation of that authoritarian notion
of the subject? Why not pursue the decentering of the subject and its
universalizing epistemic strategies? Although Wittig criticizes “the
straight mind” for universalizing its point of view, it appears that she
not only universalizes “the” straight mind, but fails to consider the
totalitarian consequences of such a theory of sovereign speech acts.
Politically, the division of being—a violence against the field of
ontological plenitude, in her view—into the distinction between the
universal and the particular conditions a relation of subjection.
Domination must be understood as the denial of a prior and primary
unity of all persons in a prelinguistic being. Domination occurs
through a language which, in its plastic social action, creates a secondorder, artificial ontology, an illusion of difference, disparity, <a name="b-35"></a>and, consequently, hierarchy that becomes social reality.
~
Paradoxically, Wittig nowhere entertains an Aristophanic myth
about the original unity of genders, for gender is a divisive principle, a
tool of subjection, one that resists the very notion of unity.
Significantly, her novels </span><span class="c-1">follow a narrative strategy of disintegration,
suggesting that the binary formulation of sex needs to fragment and
proliferate to the point where the binary itself is revealed as contingent.</span><span class="c-0"> The free play of attributes or “physical features” is never an
absolute destruction, for the ontological field distorted by gender is
one of continuous plenitude. Wittig criticizes “the straight mind” for
being unable to liberate itself from the thought of “difference.” In temporary alliance with Deleuze and Guattarri, Wittig opposes psychoanalysis as a science predicated on an economy of “lack” and “negation.”
In “Paradigm,” an early essay, Wittig considers that the overthrow of
the system of binary sex might initiate a cultural field of many sexes. In
that essay she refers to Anti-Oedipus: “For us there are, not one or two
sexes, but many (cf. Guattarri/Deleuze), as many sexes as there are
individuals.”39 The limitless proliferation of sexes, however, logically
entails the negation of sex as such. If the </span><span class="c-1">number of sexes corresponds
to the number of existing individuals, sex would no longer have any
general application as a term:</span><span class="c-0"> one’s sex would be a radically singular
property and would no longer be able to operate as a useful or descriptive generalization.
The metaphors of destruction, overthrow, and violence that work
in Wittig’s theory and fiction have a difficult ontological status.
Although linguistic categories shape reality in a “violent” way, creating
social fictions in the name of the real, there appears to be a truer reality, an ontological field of unity against which these social fictions are
measured.Wittig refuses the distinction between an “abstract” concept
and a “material” reality, arguing that concepts are formed and circulated within the materiality of language and that that language works in a
material way to construct the social world.40 On the other hand, these
“constructions” are understood as distortions and reifications to be
judged against a prior ontological field of radical unity and plenitude.
~
Constructs are thus “real” to the extent that they are fictive phenomena
that gain power within discourse.These constructs are disempowered,
however, through locutionary acts that implicitly seek recourse to the
universality of language and the unity of Being.Wittig argues that “it is
quite possible for a work of literature to operate as a war machine,”
even “a perfect war machine.”41 The main strategy of this war is for
women, lesbians, and gay men—all of whom have been particularized
through an identification with “sex”—to </span><span class="c-1">preempt the position of the
speaking subject and its invocation of the universal point of view.</span><span class="c-0">
The question of how a particular and relative subject can speak his
or her way out of the category of sex directs Wittig’s various considerations of Djuna Barnes,42 Marcel Proust,43 and Natalie Sarraute.44 The
literary text as war machine is, in each instance, directed against the
hierarchical division of gender, the </span><span class="c-1">splitting of universal and particular
in the name of a recovery of a prior and essential unity of those terms.</span><span class="c-0">
To universalize the point of view of women is simultaneously to destroy
the category of women and to establish the possibility of a new humanism. </span><span class="c-1">Destruction is thus always restoration—that is, the destruction of
a set of categories that introduce artificial divisions into an otherwise
unified ontology.</span><span class="c-0">
Literary works, however, maintain a privileged access to this primary field of ontological abundance.The split between form and content corresponds to the artificial philosophical distinction between
abstract, universal thought and concrete, material reality. Just as
Wittig invokes Bakhtin to establish concepts as material realities, so
she invokes literary language more generally to reestablish the unity of
language as indissoluble form and content: “through literature . . .
words come back to us whole again”45; “language exists as a paradise
made of visible, audible, palpable, palatable words.”46 Above all, literary works offer Wittig the occasion to experiment with pronouns that
within systems of compulsory meaning conflate the masculine with
the universal and invariably particularize the feminine. In Les
Guérillères,47 she seeks to eliminate any he-they (il-ils) conjunctions,
~
indeed, any “he” (il ), and to offer elles as standing for the general, the
universal. “The goal of this approach,” she writes, “is not to </span><span class="c-4">feminize
the world but to make the categories of sex obsolete in language.</span><span class="c-0">”48
In a self-consciously defiant imperialist strategy, Wittig argues that
only by taking up the universal and absolute point of view, effectively
lesbianizing the entire world, can the compulsory order of heterosexuality be destroyed. The j/e of The Lesbian Body is supposed to establish
the lesbian, not as a split subject, but as the sovereign subject who can
wage war linguistically against a “world” that has constituted a semantic
and syntactic assault against the lesbian. Her point is not to call attention to the presence of rights of “women” or “lesbians” as individuals,
but to counter the globalizing heterosexist episteme by a reverse discourse of equal reach and power.The point is not to assume the position
of the speaking subject in order to be a recognized individual within a
set of reciprocal linguistic relations; rather, the speaking subject
becomes more than the individual, becomes an absolute perspective
that imposes its categories on the entire linguistic field, known as “the
world.” Only a war strategy that rivals the proportions of compulsory
heterosexuality,Wittig argues, will operate effectively to challenge the
latter’s epistemic hegemony.
In its ideal sense, speaking is, for Wittig, a potent act, an assertion
of sovereignty that simultaneously implies a relationship of equality
with other speaking subjects.49 This ideal or primary “contract” of language operates at an implicit level. Language has a dual possibility: It
can be used to assert a true and inclusive universality of persons, or it
can institute a hierarchy in which only some persons are eligible to
speak and others, by virtue of their exclusion from the universal point
of view, cannot “speak” without simultaneously deauthorizing that
speech. Prior to this asymmetrical relation to speech, however, is an
ideal social contract, one in which every first-person speech act presupposes and affirms an absolute reciprocity among speaking subjects—Wittig’s version of the ideal speech situation. Distorting and
concealing that ideal reciprocity, however, is the heterosexual contract,
~
the focus of Wittig’s most recent theoretical work,50 although present
in her theoretical essays all along.51
Unspoken but always operative, the heterosexual contract cannot
be reduced to any of its empirical appearances.Wittig writes:
I confront a nonexistent object, a fetish, an ideological form which
</span><span class="c-1">cannot be grasped in reality, except through its effects, whose existence lies in the mind of people, but in a way that affects their whole
life, the way they act, the way they move, the way they think. So we
are dealing with an object both imaginary </span><span class="c-0">and real.52

As in Lacan, the idealization of heterosexuality appears even within
Wittig’s own formulation to exercise a control over the bodies of practicing heterosexuals that is finally impossible, indeed, that is bound to
falter on its own impossibility. Wittig appears to believe that only the
radical departure from heterosexual contexts—namely becoming lesbian or gay—can bring about the downfall of this heterosexual regime.
But this political consequence follows only if one understands all “participation” in heterosexuality to be a repetition and consolidation of
heterosexual oppression.The possibilities of resignifying heterosexuality itself are refused precisely because heterosexuality is understood as
a total system that requires a thoroughgoing displacement. The political options that follow from such a totalizing view of heterosexist
power are (a) radical conformity or (b) radical revolution.
Assuming the systemic integrity of heterosexuality is extremely
problematic both for Wittig’s understanding of heterosexual practice
and for her conception of homosexuality and lesbianism. As radically
“outside” the heterosexual matrix, homosexuality is conceived as radically unconditioned by heterosexual norms.This purification of homosexuality, a kind of lesbian modernism, is currently contested by
numerous lesbian and gay discourses that understand lesbian and gay
culture as embedded in the larger structures of heterosexuality even as
they are positioned in subversive or resignificatory relationships to
~
ity, it seems, of a volitional or optional heterosexuality; yet, even if
heterosexuality is presented as obligatory or presumptive, it does not
follow that all heterosexual acts are radically determined. Further,
Wittig’s radical disjunction between straight and gay replicates the
kind of disjunctive binarism that she herself characterizes as the divisive philosophical gesture of the straight mind.
My own </span><span class="c-1">conviction is that the radical disjunction posited by Wittig
between heterosexuality and homosexuality is simply not true, that
</span><span class="c-3">there are structures of psychic homosexuality within heterosexual relations, and structures of psychic heterosexuality within gay and lesbian
sexuality and relationships.</span><span class="c-1"> Further, </span><span class="c-3">there are other power/discourse
centers that construct and structure both gay and straight sexuality;</span><span class="c-1">
heterosexuality is not the only compulsory display of power that
informs sexuality.</span><span class="c-0"> The </span><span class="c-1">ideal of a coherent heterosexuality that Wittig
describes as the norm and standard of the heterosexual contract is an
impossible </span><span class="c-0">ideal, a “fetish,” as she herself points out. A psychoanalytic
elaboration might contend that this impossibility is exposed in virtue of
the complexity and resistance of an unconscious sexuality that is not
always already heterosexual. In this sense, </span><span class="c-1">heterosexuality offers </span><span class="c-2">normative sexual positions that are intrinsically impossible to embody, and
the persistent failure to identify fully and without incoherence with
these positions reveals heterosexuality itself not only as a compulsory
law, but as an inevitable comedy.</span><span class="c-0"> Indeed, I would offer this insight into
</span><span class="c-1">heterosexuality as both a compulsory system and an intrinsic comedy, a
constant parody </span><span class="c-0">of itself, as an alternative gay/lesbian perspective.
Clearly, the norm of compulsory heterosexuality does operate
with the force and violence that Wittig describes, but my own position
is that this is not the only w<a name="b-36"></a>ay that it operates. For Wittig, the strategies
for political resistance to normative heterosexuality are fairly direct.
Only the array of embodied persons who are not </span><span class="c-1">engaged in a heterosexual relationship within the confines of the family which takes reproduction to be the end or telos of sexuality </span><span class="c-0">are, in effect, actively
contesting the categories of sex or, at least, not in compliance with the
~
normative presuppositions and purposes of that set of categories.To be
lesbian or gay is, for Wittig, no longer to know one’s sex, to be engaged
in a confusion and proliferation of categories that make sex an impossible category of identity. As emancipatory as this sounds, Wittig’s proposal overrides those discourses within gay and lesbian culture that
proliferate specifically gay sexual identities by appropriating and redeploying the categories of sex. The terms queens, butches, femmes, girls,
even the parodic reappropriation of dyke, queer, and fag redeploy and
destabilize the categories of sex and the originally derogatory categories for homosexual identity. All of these terms might be understood
as symptomatic of “the straight mind,” modes of identifying with the
oppressor’s version of the identity of the oppressed. On the other
hand, lesbian has surely been partially reclaimed from it historical
meanings, and parodic categories serve the purposes of denaturalizing
sex itself. When the neighborhood gay restaurant closes for vacation,
the owners put out a sign, explaining that “she’s overworked and needs
a rest.” This very gay appropriation of the feminine works to multiply
possible sites of application of the term, to </span><span class="c-2">reveal the arbitrary relation
between the signifier and the signified, and to destabilize and mobilize
the sign.</span><span class="c-0"> Is this a colonizing “appropriation” of the feminine? My sense
is no.That </span><span class="c-1">accusation assumes that the feminine belongs to women, an
assumption surely suspect.</span><span class="c-0">
</span><span class="c-1">Within lesbian contexts, the “identification” with </span><span class="c-3">masculinity that
appears as butch identity is not a simple assimilation of lesbianism back
into the terms of heterosexuality.</span><span class="c-2"> As one </span><span class="c-3">lesbian femme explained, she
likes her boys to be girls,</span><span class="c-2"> meaning that “being a girl” contextualizes and
resignifies “masculinity” in a butch identity. As a </span><span class="c-3">result, that masculinity, if that it can be called, is </span><span class="c-4">always brought into relief against a
culturally intelligible “female body.</span><span class="c-2">” It is precisely this dissonant juxtaposition and the sexual tension that its transgression generates that
constitute the object of desire.</span><span class="c-1"> In other words, the </span><span class="c-2">object [and clearly,
there is not just one] of lesbian-femme desire is neither some decontextualized female body nor a discrete yet superimposed masculine
~
identity,</span><span class="c-1"> but the destabilization of both terms as they come into erotic
interplay. Similarly, some heterosexual or bisexual women may well
prefer that the relation of “figure” to “ground” work in the opposite
direction—that is, they may prefer that their girls be boys. In that case,
the perception of “feminine” identity would be juxtaposed on the
“male body” as ground, but both terms would, through the juxtaposition, lose their internal stability and distinctness </span><span class="c-0">from each other.
Clearly, this way of thinking about gendered exchanges of desire
admits of much greater complexity, for the play of masculine and feminine, as well as the inversion of ground to figure can constitute a highly complex and structured production of desire. Significantly, both the
sexed body as “ground” and the butch or femme identity as “figure” can
shift, invert, and create erotic havoc of various sorts. Neither can lay
claim to “the real,” although either can qualify as an object of belief,
depending on the dynamic of the sexual exchange.The </span><span class="c-2">idea that butch
and femme are in some sense “replicas” or “copies” of </span><span class="c-3">heterosexual
exchange underestimates the erotic significance of these identities as
internally dissonant and complex in their resignification of the hegemonic categories by which they are enabled.</span><span class="c-0"> </span><span class="c-1">Lesbian femmes may
recall the heterosexual scene, as it were,</span><span class="c-0"> but also displace it at the same
time. In both </span><span class="c-1">butch and femme identities, the very notion of an original or natural identity is put into question;</span><span class="c-0"> indeed, it is precisely that
question as it is embodied in these identities that becomes one source
of their erotic significance.
Although Wittig does not discuss the meaning of butch/femme
identities, her notion of fictive sex suggests a similar dissimulation of a
natural or original notion of gendered coherence assumed to exist
among sexed bodies, gender identities, and sexualities. Implicit in
Wittig’s description of sex as a fictive category is the notion that the
various components of “sex” may well disaggregate. In such a breakdown of bodily coherence, the category of sex could no longer operate
descriptively in any given cultural domain. If the category of “sex” is
established through repeated acts, then conversely, the social action of
~
bodies within the cultural field can withdraw the very power of reality
that they themselves invested in the category.
For power to be withdrawn, power itself would have to be understood as the retractable operation of volition; indeed, the heterosexual
contract would be understood to be sustained through a series of
choices, just as the social contract in Locke or Rousseau is understood
to presuppose the rational choice or deliberate will of those it is said
to govern. If power is not reduced to volition, however, and the classical liberal and existential model of freedom is refused, then powerrelations can be understood, as I think they ought to be, as constraining
and constituting the very possibilities of volition. </span><span class="c-1">Hence, </span><span class="c-3">power can be
neither withdrawn nor refused, but only redeployed. Indeed, in my
view, the normative focus for gay and lesbian practice ought to be on
the </span><span class="c-4">subversive and parodic redeployment of power rather than on the
impossible fantasy </span><span class="c-3">of its full-scale transcendence.</span><span class="c-0">
Whereas Wittig clearly envisions lesbianism to be a full-scale
refusal of heterosexuality, I would argue that even that refusal </span><span class="c-1">constitutes an engagement and, ultimately, a radical dependence on the very
terms that lesbianism purports to transcend.</span><span class="c-0"> If sexuality and power are
coextensive, and if lesbian sexuality is no more and no less constructed
than other modes of sexuality, then there is no promise of limitless
pleasure after the shackles of the category of sex have been thrown off.
The structuring presence of heterosexual constructs within gay and
lesbian sexuality does not mean that those constructs determine gay and
lesbian sexuality nor that gay and lesbian sexuality are derivable or
reducible to those constructs. Indeed, consider the disempowering and
denaturalizing effects of a specifically gay deployment of heterosexual
constructs. The presence of these norms not only constitute a site of
power that cannot be refused, but they can and do become the site of
parodic contest and display that robs compulsory heterosexuality of its
claims to naturalness and originality.Wittig calls for a position beyond
sex that returns her theory to a problematic humanism based in a
problematic metaphysics of presence. And yet, her literary works
~
appear to enact a different kind of political strategy than the one for
which she explicitly calls in her theoretical essays. In The Lesbian Body
and in Les Guérillères, the narrative strategy through which political
transformation is articulated makes use of redeployment and transvaluation time and again both to make use of originally oppressive terms
and to deprive them of their legitimating functions.
Although Wittig herself is a “materialist,” the term has a specific
meaning within her theoretical framework. She wants to overcome
the split between materiality and representation that characterizes
“straight” thinking. Materialism implies neither a reduction of ideas
to matter nor the view of theory as a reflection of its economic base,
strictly conceived.Wittig’s materialism takes social institutions and practices, in particular, the institution of heterosexuality, as the basis of critical analysis. In “The Straight Mind” and “On the Social Contract,”53 she
understands the institution of heterosexuality as the founding basis of the
male-dominated social orders. “Nature” and the domain of materiality
are ideas, ideological constructs, produced by these social institutions to
support the political interests of the heterosexual contract. In this sense,
Wittig is a classic idealist for whom nature is understood as a mental representation.A language of compulsory meanings produces this representation of nature to further the political strategy of sexual domination and
to rationalize the institution of compulsory heterosexuality.
Unlike Beauvoir,Wittig </span><span class="c-1">sees nature not as a resistant materiality, a
medium, surface, or an object;</span><span class="c-0"> it is an “idea” generated and sustained
for the purposes of social control. The very elasticity of the ostensible
materiality of the body is shown in The Lesbian Body as language figures
and refigures the parts of the body into radically new social configurations of form (and antiform). Like those mundane and scientific languages that circulate the idea of “nature” and so produce the
naturalized conception of discretely sexed bodies, Wittig’s own language enacts an alternative disfiguring and refiguring of bodies. Her
aim is to expose the idea of a natural body as a construction and to
offer a deconstructive/reconstructive set of strategies for configuring
~
bodies to contest the power of heterosexuality. The very shape and
form of bodies, their unifying principle, their composite parts, are
always figured by a language imbued with political interests. For
</span><span class="c-1">Wittig, the political challenge is to seize language as the means of representation and production, to treat it as an instrument that invariably
constructs the field of bodies and that ought to be used to deconstruct
and reconstruct bodies outside the oppressive categories of sex.</span><span class="c-0">
If the multiplication of gender possibilities expose and disrupt the
binary reifications of gender, what is the nature of such a subversive
enactment? How can such an enactment constitute a subversion? In
The Lesbian Body, the act of love-making literally tears the bodies of its
partners apart. As lesbian sexuality, this set of acts outside of the reproductive matrix produces the body itself as an incoherent center of
attributes, gestures, and desires. And in Wittig’s Les Guérillères, the
same kind of disintegrating effect, even violence, emerges in the struggle between the “women” and their oppressors. In that context,Wittig
clearly distances herself from those who would defend the notion of a
“specifically feminine” pleasure, writing, or identity; she all but mocks
those who would hold up the “circle” as their emblem. For Wittig, the
tas<a name="b-37"></a>k is not to prefer the feminine side of the binary to the masculine,
but to displace the binary as such through a specifically lesbian disintegration of its constitutive categories.
The disintegration appears literal in the fictional text, as does the
violent struggle in Les Guérillères. Wittig’s texts have been criticized for
this use of violence and force—notions that on the surface seem antithetical to feminist aims. But note that Wittig’s narrative strategy is not
to identify the feminine through a strategy of differentiation or exclusion from the masculine. Such a strategy consolidates hierarchy and
binarisms through a transvaluation of values by which women now
represent the domain of positive value. In contrast to a strategy that
consolidates women’s identity through an exclusionary process of differentiation, Wittig offers a strategy of reappropriation and subversive
redeployment of precisely those “values” that originally appeared to
~
belong to the masculine domain. One might well object that Wittig has
assimilated masculine values or, indeed, that she is “male-identified,”
but the very notion of “identification” reemerges in the context of this
literary production as immeasurably more complex than the uncritical
use of that term suggests. The </span><span class="c-2">violence and struggle in her text is, significantly, recontextualized, no longer sustaining the same meanings
that it has in oppressive contexts. It is neither a simple “turning of the
tables” in which women now wage violence against men, nor a simple
internalization of masculine norms such that women now wage violence
against themselves.The </span><span class="c-3">violence of the text has the identity and coherence of the category of sex as its target,</span><span class="c-2"> a lifeless construct, a construct
out to deaden the body.</span><span class="c-0"> Because that category is the naturalized construct that makes the institution of normative heterosexuality seem
inevitable, Wittig’s textual violence is enacted against that institution,
and not primarily for its heterosexuality, but for its compulsoriness.
Note as </span><span class="c-1">well that the </span><span class="c-2">category of sex and the naturalized institution
of heterosexuality are constructs, socially instituted and socially regulated fantasies </span><span class="c-1">or “fetishes,” not natural categories, but political ones (categories that prove that recourse to the “natural” in such contexts is
always political). Hence, the body which is torn apart, the wars waged
among women, are </span><span class="c-3">textual violences, the deconstruction of constructs
that are always already a kind of violence against the body’</span><span class="c-0">s possibilities.
But here we might ask:What is left when the body rendered coherent through the category of sex is disaggregated, rendered chaotic? Can
this body be re-membered, be put back together again? Are there possibilities of agency that do not require the coherent reassembling of
this construct? Wittig’s text not only deconstructs sex and offers a
way to disintegrate the false unity designated by sex, but enacts as well
a kind of diffuse corporeal agency generated from a number of different
centers of power. Indeed, the source of personal and political agency
comes not from within the individual, but in and through the complex cultural exchanges among bodies in which identity itself is evershifting, indeed, where identity itself is constructed, disintegrated, and
~
recirculated only within the context of a dynamic field of cultural relations. To be a woman is, then, for Wittig as well as for Beauvoir, to
become a woman, but because this process is in no sense fixed, it is possible to become a being whom neither man nor woman truly describes.
This is not the figure of the androgyne nor some hypothetical “third
gender,” nor is it a transcendence of the binary. Instead, it is an internal
subversion in which the binary is both presupposed and proliferated to
the point where it no longer makes sense.The force of Wittig’s fiction,
its linguistic challenge, is to offer an experience beyond the categories
of identity, an erotic struggle to create new categories from the ruins of
the old, new ways of being a body within the cultural field, and whole
new languages of description.
In response to Beauvoir’s notion “one is not born a woman, but,
rather, becomes one,”Wittig claims that instead of becoming a woman,
one (anyone?) can become a lesbian. By refusing the category of
women, Wittig’s lesbian-feminism appears to cut off any kind of solidarity with heterosexual women and implicitly to assume that lesbianism is the logically or politically necessary consequence of feminism.
This kind of separatist prescriptivism is surely no longer viable. But
even if it were politically desirable, what criteria would be used to
decide the question of sexual “identity”?
If to become a lesbian is an act, a leave-taking of heterosexuality, a
self-naming that contests the compulsory meanings of heterosexuality’s women and men, what is to keep the name of lesbian from becoming
an equally compulsory category? What qualifies as a lesbian? Does anyone know? If a lesbian refutes the radical disjunction between heterosexual and homosexual economies that Wittig promotes, is that lesbian
no longer a lesbian? And if it is an “act” that founds the identity as a performative accomplishment of sexuality, are there certain kinds of acts
that qualify over others as foundational? Can one do the act with a
“straight mind”? Can one understand lesbian sexuality not only as a
contestation of the category of “sex,” of “women,” of “natural bodies,”
but also of “lesbian”?
~
Interestingly,Wittig suggests a necessary relationship between the
homosexual point of view and that of figurative language, as if to be a
homosexual is to contest the compulsory syntax and semantics that
construct “the real.” Excluded from the real, the homosexual point of
view, if there is one, might well understand the real as constituted
through a set of exclusions, margins that do not appear, absences that
do not figure. What a </span><span class="c-1">tragic mistake, then, to construct a gay/lesbian
identity through the same exclusionary means, as if the excluded were
not, precisely through its exclusion, always presupposed and, indeed,
required for the construction of that identity. Such an exclusion, paradoxically, institutes precisely the relation of radical dependency it
seeks to overcome: Lesbianism would then require heterosexuality.</span><span class="c-0">
Lesbianism that defines itself in radical exclusion from heterosexuality
deprives itself of the capacity to resignify the very heterosexual constructs by which it is partially and inevitably constituted. As a result,
that lesbian strategy would consolidate compulsory heterosexuality in
its oppressive forms.
The more insidious and effective strategy it seems is a </span><span class="c-1">thoroughgoing appropriation and redeployment of the categories of identity
themselves, not merely to contest “sex,” but to articulate the convergence of multiple sexual discourses at the site of “identity” in </span><span class="c-2">order to
render that category, in whatever form, permanently problematic.</span><span class="c-0">
iv. Bodily Inscriptions, Performative Subversions
“Garbo ‘got in drag’ whenever she took some heavy glamour part, whenever she melted in or out of a man’s arms, whenever she simply let that
heavenly-flexed neck . . . bear the weight of her thrown-back head. . . .
How resplendent seems the art of acting! It is all impersonation,
whether the sex underneath is true or not.”
—Parker Tyler, “The Garbo Image” quoted
in Esther Newton, Mother Camp

Categories of true sex, discrete gender, and specific sexuality have
constituted the stable point of reference for a great deal of feminist
~
theory and politics. These constructs of identity serve as the points of
epistemic departure from which theory emerges and politics itself is
shaped. In the case of feminism, politics is ostensibly shaped to express
the interests, the perspectives, of “women.” But is there a political
shape to “women,” as it were, that precedes and prefigures the political
elaboration of their interests and epistemic point of view? How is that
identity shaped, and is it a political shaping that takes the very morphology and boundary of the sexed body as the ground, surface, or site
of cultural inscription? What circumscribes that site as “the female
body” ? Is “the body” or “the sexed body” the firm foundation on which
gender and systems of compulsory sexuality operate? Or is “the body”
itself shaped by political forces with strategic interests in keeping that
body bounded and constituted by the markers of sex?
The sex/gender distinction and the category of sex itself appear to
presuppose a generalization of “the body” that preexists the acquisition
of its sexed significance. This “</span><span class="c-1">body” often appears to be a passive
medium that is signified by an inscription from a cultural source figured as “external” to that body. Any theory of the </span><span class="c-2">culturally constructed body, however, ought to question “the body” as a construct of
suspect generality when it is figured as passive and prior to discourse.</span><span class="c-0">
There are Christian and Cartesian precedents to such views which,
prior to the emergence of vitalistic biologies in the nineteenth century,
understand “the body” as so much inert matter, signifying nothing or,
more specifically, signifying a profane void, the fallen state: deception,
sin, the premonitional metaphorics of hell and the eternal feminine.
There are many occasions in both Sartre’s and Beauvoir’s work where
“the body” is figured as a mute facticity, anticipating some meaning that
can be attributed only by a transcendent consciousness, understood in
Cartesian terms as radically immaterial. But what establishes this dualism for us? What separates off “the body” as indifferent to signification,
and signification itself as the act of a radically disembodied consciousness or, rather, the act that radically disembodies that consciousness? To
what extent is that Cartesian dualism presupposed in phenomenology
~
adapted to the structuralist frame in which mind/body is redescribed
as culture/nature? With respect to gender discourse, to what extent
do these problematic dualisms still operate within the very descriptions that are supposed to lead us out of that binarism and its implicit
hierarchy? How are the contours of the body clearly marked as the
taken-for-granted ground or surface upon which gender significations
are inscribed, a mere facticity devoid of value, prior to significance?
Wittig suggests that a culturally specific epistemic a priori establishes the naturalness of “sex.” But by what enigmatic means has “the
body” been accepted as a prima facie given that admits of no genealogy?
Even within Foucault’s essay on the very theme of genealogy, the body
is figured as a surface and the scene of a cultural inscription: “the body
is the inscribed surface of events.”54 The task of genealogy, he claims, is
“to expose a body totally imprinted by history.” His sentence continues, however,<a name="b-38"></a> by referring to the goal of “history”—here clearly
understood on the model of Freud’s “civilization”—as the “destruction
of the body” (148). Forces and impulses with multiple directionalities
are precisely that which history both destroys and preserves through
the Entstehung (historical event) of inscription. As “a volume in perpetual disintegration” (148), the body is always under siege, suffering
destruction by the very terms of history. And history is the creation of
values and meanings by a signifying practice that requires the subjection of the body.This corporeal destruction is necessary to produce the
speaking subject and its significations.This is a body, described through
the language of surface and force, weakened through a “single drama”
of domination, inscription, and creation (150). This is not the modus
vivendi of one kind of history rather than another, but is, for Foucault,
“history” (148) in its essential and repressive gesture.
Although Foucault writes, “Nothing in man [sic]—not </span><span class="c-4">even his
body—is sufficiently stable to serve as the basis for self-recognition or
for understanding other </span><span class="c-2">men </span><span class="c-0">[sic]” (153), he nevertheless points to the
constancy of cultural inscription as a “single drama” that acts on the
body. If the creation of values, that historical mode of signification,
~
requires the destruction of the body, much as the instrument of torture in Kafka’s “In the Penal Colony” destroys the body on which it
writes, then </span><span class="c-1">there must be a body prior to that inscription, stable and
self-identical, subject to that sacrificial destruction. In a sense,</span><span class="c-0"> for
Foucault, as for Nietzsche, </span><span class="c-1">cultural values emerge as the result of an
inscription on the body, understood as a medium, indeed, a blank
page; in order for this inscription to signify, however, that medium
must itself be destroyed—that is, fully transvaluated into a sublimated
domain of values.</span><span class="c-0">Within the metaphorics of this notion of cultural values is the figure of history as a relentless writing instrument, and the
</span><span class="c-1">body as the medium which must be destroyed and transfigured in
order for “culture”</span><span class="c-0"> to emerge.
By maintaining a body prior to its cultural inscription, Foucault
appears to assume a materiality prior to signification and form. Because
this distinction operates as essential to the task of genealogy as he
defines it, the distinction itself is precluded as an object of genealogical
investigation. Occasionally in his analysis of Herculine, Foucault subscribes to a prediscursive multiplicity of bodily forces that break
through the surface of the body to disrupt the regulating practices of
cultural coherence imposed upon that body by a power regime, understood as a vicissitude of “history.” If the </span><span class="c-2">presumption of some kind of
precategorial source of disruption is refused, is it still possible to give a
genealogical account of the demarcation of the body as such as a signifying practice? This demarcation is not initiated by a reified history or by a
subject. This marking is the result of a diffuse and active structuring of
the social field. This signifying practice effects a social space for and of
the body within certain regulatory grids of intelligibility.</span><span class="c-0">
Mary Douglas’s Purity and Danger suggests that the very contours
of “the body” are established through markings that seek to establish
specific codes of cultural coherence. Any discourse that establishes the
boundaries of the body serves the purpose of instating and naturalizing
certain taboos regarding the appropriate limits, postures, and modes
of exchange that define what it is that constitutes bodies:
~
</span><span class="c-1">ideas about </span><span class="c-2">separating, purifying, demarcating and punishing transgressions have as their main function to </span><span class="c-3">impose system on an inherently untidy experience. It is only by exaggerating the difference
between within and without, above and below, male and female, with
and against, that a semblance of order is created.</span><span class="c-0">55

Although Douglas clearly subscribes to a structuralist distinction
between an inherently unruly nature and an order imposed by cultural
means, the “untidiness” to which she refers can be redescribed as a
region of cultural unruliness and disorder. Assuming the inevitably
binary structure of the nature/culture distinction, Douglas cannot
point toward an alternative configuration of culture in which such distinctions become malleable or proliferate beyond the binary frame.
Her analysis, however, provides a possible point of departure for
</span><span class="c-2">understanding the relationship by which social taboos institute and
maintain the boundaries of the body as such. Her analysis suggests that
what constitutes the limit of the body is never merely material, but
that the surface, the skin, is systemically signified by taboos and anticipated transgressions; indeed, the boundaries of the body become,
within her analysis, the limits of the social per se.</span><span class="c-0"> A poststructuralist
appropriation of her view </span><span class="c-1">might well understand the boundaries of the
body as the limits of the socially </span><span class="c-0">hegemonic. In a variety of cultures, she
maintains, there are
pollution powers which inhere in the structure of </span><span class="c-2">ideas itself and
which punish a symbolic breaking of that which should be joined or
joining of that which should be separate. It follows from this that pollution is a type of danger which is not likely to occur except where
the lines of structure, cosmic or social, are clearly defined.</span><span class="c-0">
A polluting person is always in the wrong. He [sic] has </span><span class="c-1">developed
some wrong condition or simply crossed over some line which
should not have been crossed and this displacement unleashes danger
for someone.</span><span class="c-0">56

~
In a sense, Simon Watney has identified the contemporary construction of “the polluting person” as the person with AIDS in his
Policing Desire: AIDS, Pornography, and the Media.57 Not only is the illness
figured as the “gay disease,” but throughout the media’s </span><span class="c-1">hysterical and
homophobic response to the illness there is a tactical construction of a
continuity between the polluted status of the homosexual by virtue of
the boundary-trespass that is homosexuality and the disease as a specific modality of homosexual pollution.</span><span class="c-0"> That the disease is transmitted
through the exchange of bodily fluids suggests within the sensationalist
graphics of homophobic signifying systems the </span><span class="c-2">dangers that permeable
bodily boundaries present to the social order </span><span class="c-0">as such. Douglas remarks
that “the body is a model that can stand for any bounded system. Its
boundaries can represent any boundaries which are threatened or precarious.”58 And she asks a question which one might have expected to
read in Foucault: “Why should bodily margins be thought to be specifically invested with power and danger?”59
Douglas suggests that all social systems are vulnerable at their
margins, and that all margins are accordingly considered dangerous.
If the body is synecdochal for the social system per se or a site in which
open systems converge, then any kind of unregulated permeability constitutes a site of pollution and endangerment. Since anal and
oral sex among men clearly establishes certain kinds of bodily permeabilities unsanctioned by the hegemonic order, male homosexuality would, within such a hegemonic point of view, constitute a
site of danger and pollution, prior to and regardless of the cultural
presence of AIDS. Similarly, the “polluted” status of lesbians, regardless
of their low-risk status with respect to AIDS, brings into relief
the dangers of their bodily exchanges. Significantly, being “</span><span class="c-1">outside”
the hegemonic order does not signify being “in” a state of filthy
and untidy nature. Paradoxically, homosexuality is almost always
conceived within the homophobic signifying economy as both uncivilized and unnatural.</span><span class="c-0">

~
The </span><span class="c-4">construction of stable bodily contours relies upon </span><span class="c-5">fixed sites
of corporeal permeability </span><span class="c-4">and impermeability.</span><span class="c-2"> Those sexual practices
in both homosexual and heterosexual contexts that open surfaces and
orifices to erotic signification or close down others effectively reinscribe the boundaries of the body along new cultural lines.</span><span class="c-1"> Anal sex
among men is an example,</span><span class="c-0"> as is the radical re-membering of the body
in Wittig’s The Lesbian Body. Douglas alludes to “a kind of sex pollution
which expresses a desire to keep the body (physical and social)
intact,”60 suggesting that the naturalized notion of “the” body is itself a
consequence of taboos that render that body discrete by virtue of its
stable boundaries. </span><span class="c-1">Further, the </span><span class="c-2">rites of passage that govern various
bodily orifices presuppose a heterosexual construction of gendered
exchange, positions, and erotic possibilities.</span><span class="c-1"> The deregulation of such
</span><span class="c-2">exchanges accordingly disrupts the very boundaries that determine
what it is to be a body at all.</span><span class="c-0"> Indeed, the critical inquiry that traces the
regulatory practices within which bodily contours are constructed
constitutes precisely the genealogy of “the body” in its discreteness that
might further radicalize Foucault’s theory.61
Significantly, Kristeva’s discussion of abjection in Powers of Horror
begins to suggest the uses of this structuralist notion of a boundaryconstituting taboo for the purposes of constructing a discrete subject
through exclusion.62 The “</span><span class="c-9">abject” designates that which has been
expelled from the </span><span class="c-10">body, discharged as excrement, literally rendered
“Other.</span><span class="c-5">”This appears as an expulsion of alien elements, but the alien is
effectively established through this expulsion.</span><span class="c-4"> The construction </span><span class="c-3">of the
“not-me” as the abject establishes the boundaries of the body which
are also the first contours of the subject.</span><span class="c-0"> Kristeva writes:
nausea makes me balk at that milk cream, separates me from the
mother and father who proffer it. “I” want none of that element, sign
of their desire; “I” do not want to listen, “I” do not assimilate it, “I”
expel it. But since the food is not an “other” for “me,” who am only in

~
their desire, I </span><span class="c-1">expel myself, I spit myself out, I abject myself within the
same motion through which “I” claim to establish </span><span class="c-0">myself.63

The </span><span class="c-3">boundary of the body as well as the distinction between internal and external is established through the ejection and transvaluation
of something originally part of identity into a defiling otherness.</span><span class="c-0"> As
Iris Young has suggested in her use of Kristeva to understand sexism,
homophobia, and racism, the </span><span class="c-1">repudiation of bodies for their sex, sexuality, and/or color is an “</span><span class="c-2">expulsion” followed by a “repulsion” that
founds and consolidates culturally hegemonic identities along
sex/race/sexuality axes of differentiation.</span><span class="c-1">64 Young’s appropriation of
Kristeva shows how the </span><span class="c-2">operation of repulsion can consolidate “identities” founded on the instituting of the “Other” or a set of Others
through exclusion </span><span class="c-1">and domination.</span><span class="c-0"> What constitutes through division
the “inner” and “outer” </span><span class="c-4">worlds of the subject is a border and boundary
tenuously maintained for the purposes of social regulation and control.</span><span class="c-0"> The </span><span class="c-2">boundary be<a name="b-39"></a>tween the inner and outer is confounded by
those excremental passages in which the inner effectively becomes
outer, and this excreting function becomes, as it were, the model by
which other forms of identity-differentiation are </span><span class="c-3">accomplished.</span><span class="c-2"> In
effect, this is the mode by which Others become </span><span class="c-1">shit. For inner and
outer </span><span class="c-2">worlds to remain utterly distinct, the entire surface of the body
would have to achieve an impossible impermeability.</span><span class="c-1">This sealing of its
surfaces would constitute the seamless boundary of the subject; but
this enclosure would invariably be exploded by precisely that excremental filth that it fears.</span><span class="c-0">
Regardless of the compelling metaphors of the spatial distinctions
of inner and outer, they remain linguistic terms that facilitate and articulate a set of fantasies, feared and desired. “Inner” and “outer” </span><span class="c-2">make
sense only with reference to a mediating boundary that strives for stability.</span><span class="c-1"> And this stability, this coherence, is determined in large part by
cultural orders that sanction the subject and compel its differentiation
</span><span class="c-0">~
tion that stabilizes and consolidates the coherent subject. When that
subject is challenged, the meaning and necessity of the terms are subject to displacement. If the “inner world” no longer designates a topos,
then the internal fixity of the self and, indeed, the internal locale of
gender identity, become similarly suspect. The critical question is not
how did that identity become internalized? as if internalization were a
process or a mechanism that might be descriptively reconstructed.
Rather, the question is: From what </span><span class="c-2">strategic position in public discourse
and for what </span><span class="c-3">reasons has the trope of interiority and the disjunctive
binary of inner/outer taken hold?</span><span class="c-2"> In what language </span><span class="c-0">is “inner space” figured? What kind of figuration is it, and through what figure of the body
is it signified? How does a body figure on its surface the very invisibility
of its hidden depth?
From Interiority to Gender Performatives
In Discipline and Punish Foucault challenges the language of internalization as it operates in the service of the disciplinary regime of the subjection and subjectivation of criminals.65 Although Foucault objected
to what he understood to be the psychoanalytic belief in the “inner”
truth of sex in The History of Sexuality, he turns to a criticism of the
doctrine of internalization for separate purposes in the context of his
history of criminology. In a sense, Discipline and Punish can be read as
Foucault’s effort to rewrite Nietzsche’s doctrine of internalization in
On the Genealogy of Morals on the model of inscription. In the context of
prisoners, Foucault writes, the strategy has been not to enforce a
repression of their desires, but to compel their bodies to signify the
prohibitive law as their very essence, style, and necessity. That law is
not literally internalized, but incorporated, with the consequence that
bodies are produced which signify that law on and through the body;
there the law is manifest as the essence of their selves, the meaning of
their soul, their conscience, the law of their desire. In effect, the law is
at once fully manifest and fully latent, for it never appears as external
to the bodies it subjects and subjectivates. Foucault writes:
~
It </span><span class="c-2">would be wrong to say that the soul is an illusion, or an ideological
effect. On the contrary, it exists, it has a reality, it is produced permanently around, on, within, the body by the functioning of a power
that is exercised </span><span class="c-0">on those that are punished. (my emphasis)66

The figure of the interior soul understood as “within” the body is signified through its inscription on the body, even though its primary mode
of signification is through its very absence, its potent invisibility. The
effect of a structuring inner space is produced through the signification
of a body as a vital and sacred enclosure.The </span><span class="c-1">soul is precisely what the
body lacks; hence, the body presents itself as a signifying lack.</span><span class="c-0"> That
lack which is the body signifies the soul as that which cannot show. In
this sense, then, the soul is a surface signification that contests and displaces the inner/outer distinction itself, a figure of interior psychic
space inscribed on the body as a social signification that perpetually
renounces itself as such. In </span><span class="c-1">Foucault’s terms, the soul is not imprisoned by or within the body, as some Christian imagery would suggest,
but “the soul is the prison of the body.</span><span class="c-0">”67
The redescription of intrapsychic processes in terms of the surface
politics of the body implies a corollary redescription of gender as the
disciplinary production of the figures of fantasy through the play of
presence and absence on the body’s </span><span class="c-1">surface, the construction of the
gendered body through a series of exclusions and denials, signifying
absences.</span><span class="c-0"> But what determines the manifest and latent text of the body
politic? What is the </span><span class="c-1">prohibitive law that generates the corporeal stylization of gender, the fantasied and fantastic figuration of the body? We
have already considered the incest taboo and the prior taboo against
homosexuality as the generative moments of gender identity, the prohibitions that produce identity along the culturally intelligible grids of
an idealized and compulsory heterosexuality.That disciplinary production of gender effects a </span><span class="c-2">false </span><span class="c-3">stabilization of gender in the interests of
the heterosexual construction and regulation of sexuality </span><span class="c-2">within </span><span class="c-0">the
~
der </span><span class="c-9">discontinuities that </span><span class="c-10">run rampant within heterosexual, bisexual,
and gay and lesbian </span><span class="c-12">contexts </span><span class="c-11">in which gender does not necessarily follow from sex,</span><span class="c-10"> and desire, or sexuality generally, does </span><span class="c-9">not seem to follow from gender—</span><span class="c-5">indeed, where none of these dimensions of
significant corporeality express or reflect one another.</span><span class="c-1">When the disorganization and disaggregation of the field of bodies disrupt the regulatory fiction of heterosexual coherence, it seems that the expressive
model loses its descriptive force.That regulatory ideal is then exposed
as a norm and a fiction that disguises itself as a developmental law regulating the sexual field that it purports to describe.</span><span class="c-0">
</span><span class="c-1">According to the understanding of identification as an enacted fantasy or incorporation, </span><span class="c-2">however, it is clear that </span><span class="c-3">coherence is desired,
wished for, idealized, and that </span><span class="c-5">this idealization is an </span><span class="c-6">effect of a corporeal signification. In </span><span class="c-7">other words, </span><span class="c-26">acts, </span><span class="c-30">gestures, and desire produce the
effect of an internal core </span><span class="c-28">or substance,</span><span class="c-25"> but produce this on the </span><span class="c-26">surface of
the body,</span><span class="c-21"> through the play of </span><span class="c-22">signifying absences that suggest, but
never reveal, the organizing principle of identity </span><span class="c-21">as a cause.</span><span class="c-18"> Such </span><span class="c-29">acts,
</span><span class="c-30">gestures, enactments, generally construed, </span><span class="c-40">are </span><span class="c-41">performative in the sense

of the subject.</span><span class="c-0"> In </span><span class="c-5">other </span><span class="c-8">words, </span><span class="c-11">acts and </span><span class="c-12">gestures, articulated and enacted </span><span class="c-13">desires </span><span class="c-15">create the illusion of an interior and organizing </span><span class="c-16">gender core,</span><span class="c-13">
an </span><span class="c-17">illusion discursively </span><span class="c-18">maintained </span><span class="c-17">for the purposes of the regulation
of sexuality within the obligatory frame of reproductive </span><span class="c-16">heterosexuality.</span><span class="c-1"> If the “cause” of </span><span class="c-2">desire, gesture, and act can be localized within
the “self ” of the actor, then the political regulations and disciplinary
~
practices which produce </span><span class="c-1">that ostensibly coherent gender are effectively displaced from view. The </span><span class="c-2">displacement of a political and discursive
origin of gender identity onto a psychological “core” </span><span class="c-3">precludes an
analysis of the political constitution of the gendered subject and its
fabricated notions about the ineffable interiority of its sex or of its
true </span><span class="c-1">identity.</span><span class="c-0">
If the inner </span><span class="c-10">truth of gender is a </span><span class="c-11">fabrication and if a </span><span class="c-15">true gender is a
fantasy instituted and inscribed on the surface of bodies,</span><span class="c-11"> then it seems
that </span><span class="c-14">genders can be </span><span class="c-15">neither true nor false,</span><span class="c-14"> but are only </span><span class="c-16">produced </span><span class="c-15">as the
truth effects of a discourse of primary and stable </span><span class="c-13">identity.</span><span class="c-0"> In Mother
Camp: Female Impersonators in America, anthropologist Esther Newton
suggests that the structure of impersonation reveals one of the </span><span class="c-1">key fabricating mechanisms through which the social construction of gender
takes place.</span><span class="c-0">68 I would suggest as well that </span><span class="c-7">drag </span><span class="c-8">fully </span><span class="c-10">subverts the distinction between inner and outer psychic space and </span><span class="c-13">effectively </span><span class="c-15">mocks
</span><span class="c-14">both the expressive model of gender and the notion of a true gender
</span><span class="c-13">identity.</span><span class="c-0"> Newton writes:
At its most </span><span class="c-1">complex, [drag] is a </span><span class="c-2">double inversion that says, “appearance is an illusion.” Drag says </span><span class="c-1">[Newton’s curious personification] “my
‘outside’ appearance is feminine, but my essence ‘inside’ [the body] is
masculine.” At the same time it symbolizes the opposite inversion;
“my appearance ‘outside’ [my body, my gender] is masculine but my
essence ‘inside’ [myself] is feminine.</span><span class="c-0">”69

Both claims to truth contradict one another and so displace the </span><span class="c-1">entire enactment of gender significations from the discourse of truth
and falsity.</span><span class="c-0">
The notion of an </span><span class="c-6">original or primary gender identity is often parodied within the </span><span class="c-8">cultural </span><span class="c-9">practices </span><span class="c-7">of drag, </span><span class="c-8">cross-dressing, and the sexual stylization of butch/femme identities.</span><span class="c-2"> Within feminist theory, such
parodic identities have been understood to be either </span><span class="c-1">degrading </span><span class="c-0">to
~
sexuality, </span><span class="c-1">especially in the case of butch/femme lesbian identities. But
the relation between the “imitation” and the “original” is, I think, more
complicated than that critique generally allows. Moreover, it gives us a
clue to the way in which the relationship between primary identification—that is, the original meanings accorded to gender—and subsequent gender experience might be reframed.</span><span class="c-0">The </span><span class="c-14">performance of </span><span class="c-16">drag
</span><span class="c-17">plays upon the distinction between the anatomy of the performer and
the gender that is being performed.</span><span class="c-13"> But we </span><span class="c-14">are actually in the presence
of three contingent </span><span class="c-16">dimensions of significant corporeality:</span><span class="c-14"> anatomical
sex, gender identity, and gender </span><span class="c-12">performance.</span><span class="c-7"> If the anatomy of the
performer is already distinct from the gender of the performer,</span><span class="c-5"> and
both of those </span><span class="c-3">are </span><span class="c-5">distinct from the </span><span class="c-7">gender of the performance, then the
performance suggests a dissonance not only between sex and performance,</span><span class="c-5"> but sex and gender, and </span><span class="c-7">gender and performance.</span><span class="c-2"> As </span><span class="c-6">much as
drag creates a unified picture of “woman” (what its critics often oppose),
it also </span><span class="c-7">reveals the distinctness of those aspects of gendered </span><span class="c-8">experience
which </span><span class="c-10">are falsely naturalized </span><span class="c-9">as a unity through the regulatory fiction </span><span class="c-8">of
heterosexual coherence. In </span><span class="c-40">imit<a name="b-40"></a>ating </span><span class="c-39">gender, </span><span class="c-40">drag implicitly reveals the imitative structure </span><span class="c-38">of gender </span><span class="c-29">itself—as well as its contingency.</span><span class="c-6"> Indeed, part of the
</span><span class="c-7">pleasure, the giddiness of the </span><span class="c-9">performance is in the recognition of a radical contingency in the relation between sex and gender in the face of cultural configurations of causal unities that are regularly assumed to be
natural </span><span class="c-8">and necessary.</span><span class="c-6"> In the </span><span class="c-10">place of the law of heterosexual coherence,
we </span><span class="c-12">see sex and gender </span><span class="c-10">denaturalized by means of a performance which
avows their distinctness and dramatizes the cultural mechanism of their
fabricated </span><span class="c-7">unity.</span><span class="c-0">
The notion of </span><span class="c-2">gender parody defended here </span><span class="c-3">does not assume that
there is an original which such parodic identities imitate. Indeed, the
parody </span><span class="c-2">is of the very notion of an original;</span><span class="c-0"> just as the psychoanalytic
notion of gender identification is constituted by a fantasy of a fantasy,
the transfiguration of an Other who is always already a “figure” in that
double sense, so </span><span class="c-5">gender parody </span><span class="c-6">reveals that the original identity after
which gender fashions itself is an imitation without an </span><span class="c-7">origin.</span><span class="c-2"> To be
~
more precise, it is a </span><span class="c-3">production which, in effect—that is, in its
effect—postures as an imitation. </span><span class="c-6">This </span><span class="c-11">perpetual displacement </span><span class="c-16">constitutes a fluidity of identities that suggests an openness to resignification
and recontextualization;</span><span class="c-12"> </span><span class="c-14">parodic </span><span class="c-15">proliferation </span><span class="c-16">deprives hegemonic culture and its critics of the claim to naturalized or essentialist </span><span class="c-15">gender
</span><span class="c-14">identities.</span><span class="c-7"> Although the gender meanings taken up in these parodic
styles are clearly part of hegemonic, misogynist culture, they are nevertheless denaturalized and mobilized through their parodic </span><span class="c-1">recontextualization. As imitations which effectively displace the meaning of the
original, they imitate the myth of originality </span><span class="c-0">itself. In the </span><span class="c-1">place of an
original identification which serves as a determining </span><span class="c-3">cause, </span><span class="c-4">gender
identity might be reconceived as a </span><span class="c-9">personal/cultural history of
received meanings subject to a set of imitative practices which refer
laterally to other imitations </span><span class="c-8">and which, jointly, construct the illusion of
a primary and interior gendered self </span><span class="c-4">or parody the mechanism of that
construction.</span><span class="c-0">
According to Fredric Jameson’s “Postmodernism and Consumer
Society,” the imitation that mocks the notion of an original is characteristic of pastiche rather than parody:
</span><span class="c-5">Pastiche is, like parody, the imitation of a peculiar or </span><span class="c-6">unique style, the
wearing of a stylistic mask, speech in a dead language: but it is a neutral
practice of mimicry, without parody’s ulterior motive, without the
satirical </span><span class="c-4">impulse, without laughter, without that still latent feeling that
there exists something normal compared to which what is being imitated is rather comic.</span><span class="c-3"> Pastiche is blank parody, parody that has lost it
humor.</span><span class="c-0">70

The loss of the sense of “the normal,” however, can be its own occasion
for </span><span class="c-2">laughter, especially when “the normal,” “the </span><span class="c-3">original” is revealed to
be a </span><span class="c-5">copy, and an inevitably failed one, an ideal that no one can embody.</span><span class="c-4">
In this sense, </span><span class="c-6">laughter emerges in the realization that all along the original was derived.</span><span class="c-0">
~
stand what </span><span class="c-7">makes certain kinds of parodic repetitions effectively disruptive, truly </span><span class="c-5">troubling,</span><span class="c-3"> and which repetitions become domesticated
and recirculated as instruments of cultural </span><span class="c-2">hegemony.</span><span class="c-0"> A typology of
actions would clearly not suffice, for parodic displacement, indeed, </span><span class="c-2">parodic laughter, depends on a context and reception in which subversive
confusions </span><span class="c-0">can be fostered. What </span><span class="c-1">performance where will invert the
inner/outer distinction and </span><span class="c-2">compel a radical rethinking of the psychological presuppositions of gender identity and </span><span class="c-3">sexuality? What performance where will compel a reconsideration of the place and stability of
the masculine and the feminine?</span><span class="c-2"> And what kind of </span><span class="c-3">gender performance
will enact and reveal the performativity of gender itself in a way that
destabilizes the naturalized </span><span class="c-2">categories of identity and desire.</span><span class="c-0">
If the </span><span class="c-16">body is not a “being,” but a </span><span class="c-23">variable boundary, a surface whose
permeability is politically </span><span class="c-22">regulated,</span><span class="c-19"> a </span><span class="c-22">signifying practice within a cultural field </span><span class="c-21">of gender hierarchy </span><span class="c-17">and compulsory heterosexuality,</span><span class="c-2"> then
what language is left for understanding this corporeal enactment, gender, that constitutes its “interior” signification on its surface?</span><span class="c-0"> </span><span class="c-1">Sartre
would perhaps have called this act “a style of being,” Foucault, “a stylistics of existence.” And in my earlier reading of Beauvoir, I suggest
that </span><span class="c-3">gendered bodies are so many “styles of the flesh.</span><span class="c-2">” These styles all
</span><span class="c-3">never fully self-</span><span class="c-4">styled, for </span><span class="c-6">styles have a history, and those histories condition and limit </span><span class="c-5">the possibilities.</span><span class="c-3"> </span><span class="c-6">Consider gender, for instance, as a
</span><span class="c-10">corporeal style, an “act,” as it were, which is both intentional and performative, where “performative” suggests a dramatic and contingent
construction </span><span class="c-7">of meaning.</span><span class="c-0">
Wittig understands gender as the workings of “sex,” where “sex” is
an obligatory injunction for the body to become a cultural sign, to
materialize itself in obedience to a historically delimited possibility, and
to do this, not once or twice, but as a sustained and repeated corporeal
project. The notion of a “project,” however, suggests the originating
force of a radical will, and </span><span class="c-1">because gender is a project which has cultural survival as its end, the term strategy better suggests the </span><span class="c-2">situation of
~
</span><span class="c-3">duress under which gender performance always and variously occurs.</span><span class="c-2">
</span><span class="c-5">Hence, as a strategy of survival within compulsory systems, </span><span class="c-6">gender is a
performance with clearly punitive consequences.</span><span class="c-1"> Discrete genders are
part of what “humanizes” </span><span class="c-2">individuals within contemporary culture;</span><span class="c-1">
indeed, we regularly punish those who fail to do their gender right.</span><span class="c-0">
</span><span class="c-1">Because there is neither an “essence” that </span><span class="c-3">gender expresses or externalizes nor an objective ideal to which gender aspires, and because </span><span class="c-4">gender
is not a fact, the </span><span class="c-6">various acts of gender create the idea of gender, and
without those acts, there would be no gender at all.</span><span class="c-4"> </span><span class="c-5">Gender </span><span class="c-2">is, thus, a
</span><span class="c-4">construction that regularly </span><span class="c-5">conceals its genesis; the </span><span class="c-8">tacit collective
agreement to perform, produce, and sustain discrete and polar genders
</span><span class="c-5">as cultural </span><span class="c-4">fictions is </span><span class="c-5">obscured by the credibility of those productions—</span><span class="c-4">
and the punishments that attend not agreeing </span><span class="c-3">to believe </span><span class="c-2">in them; the
construction “compels” our belief in its necessity </span><span class="c-1">and naturalness.</span><span class="c-0"> The
historical possibilities materialized through various </span><span class="c-1">corporeal styles are
nothing other than those punitively regulated cultural fictions alternately embodied and deflected under duress.</span><span class="c-0">
</span><span class="c-1">Consider that a </span><span class="c-3">sedimentation of gender norms produces the
peculiar phenomenon of a “natural sex” or a “real woman”</span><span class="c-1"> or any number of prevalent and compelling social fictions, and that this is a </span><span class="c-3">sedimentation that over time has </span><span class="c-4">produced a set of corporeal styles </span><span class="c-3">which,
in </span><span class="c-4">reified form, appear as the natural configuration of bodies into sexes
existing in a binary relation to one another.</span><span class="c-0"> If these styles are enacted,
and if they produce the coherent gendered subjects who pose as their
originators, what kind of performance might reveal this ostensible
“cause” to be an “effect”?
In what </span><span class="c-3">senses, then, is gender an act? As in </span><span class="c-10">other ritual social dramas, the </span><span class="c-17">action of gender </span><span class="c-19">requires a performance that is repeated.</span><span class="c-16"> This
</span><span class="c-20">repetition is at </span><span class="c-21">once a </span><span class="c-23">reenactment and reexperiencing of a set of
meanings already </span><span class="c-22">socially </span><span class="c-21">established;</span><span class="c-14"> and it is the mundane and ritualized form </span><span class="c-10">of their legitimation.</span><span class="c-1">71 </span><span class="c-2">Although there are individual bodies
that enact these significations by becoming stylized into gendered
</span><span class="c-1">~
tive </span><span class="c-2">dimensions to these actions, and their public character is not
inconsequential; </span><span class="c-4">indeed, the performance is effected with the </span><span class="c-5">strategic
aim of maintaining gender </span><span class="c-4">within its binary frame—an aim </span><span class="c-3">that cannot
be attributed to a subject, but, rather, must be understood to found
and consolidate the subject.</span><span class="c-2">
</span><span class="c-27">Gender ought not to be </span><span class="c-28">construed as a </span><span class="c-34">stable identity or locus of
agency </span><span class="c-32">from which </span><span class="c-34">various acts follow;</span><span class="c-30"> rather, </span><span class="c-43">gender is an </span><span class="c-48">identity
</span><span class="c-50">tenuously constituted in time,</span><span class="c-47"> instituted in an exterior space through a
stylized repetition </span><span class="c-41">of acts.</span><span class="c-16"> The </span><span class="c-18">effect </span><span class="c-15">of gender is </span><span class="c-16">produced through the
</span><span class="c-17">stylization of the </span><span class="c-18">body and, hence, must be </span><span class="c-19">understood as the </span><span class="c-21">mundane
way in which bodily gestures, movements, and styles </span><span class="c-20">of various kinds
constitute </span><span class="c-18">the illusion of an abiding gendered </span><span class="c-15">self.</span><span class="c-0"> </span><span class="c-1">This formulation
moves the conception of gender off the ground of a substantial model
of identity to one that requires a conception of gender as a constituted
social temporality.</span><span class="c-0"> </span><span class="c-6">Significantly, if </span><span class="c-10">gender is </span><span class="c-11">instituted through acts
which are internally discontinuous, then the </span><span class="c-12">appearance of substance is
precisely </span><span class="c-11">that, a </span><span class="c-12">constructed identity, a </span><span class="c-13">performative accomplishment
which the </span><span class="c-14">mundane </span><span class="c-15">social audience, including the actors themselves,
come to believe </span><span class="c-14">and to perform in the mode </span><span class="c-12">of belief.</span><span class="c-3"> </span><span class="c-5">Gender </span><span class="c-2">is also a
</span><span class="c-3">norm that can never be fully internalized; “the </span><span class="c-4">internal” is a </span><span class="c-5">surface signification, and gender norms are finally phantasmatic, impossible </span><span class="c-4">to
embody.</span><span class="c-1"> If the </span><span class="c-2">ground of gender identity is the stylized repetition of
acts through time and not a seemingly seamless identity,</span><span class="c-1"> then the spatial metaphor of a “ground” will be displaced and revealed as a stylized
configuration, indeed, a gendered corporealization of time.</span><span class="c-0"> The abiding gendered self will then be shown to be structured by repeated </span><span class="c-1">acts
that seek to approximate the ideal of a substantial ground of identity,
but which, in their occasional </span><span class="c-0">discontinuity, reveal the temporal and
contingent groundlessness of this “ground.” The </span><span class="c-8">possibilities of gender
transformation </span><span class="c-10">are to be found precisely in the arbitrary relation
</span><span class="c-8">between such acts, in the </span><span class="c-11">possibility of a </span><span class="c-12">failure to repeat, a </span><span class="c-13">de-formity,
or a </span><span class="c-15">parodic repetition that </span><span class="c-16">exposes </span><span class="c-13">the phantasmatic effect of abiding

express or reveal.</span><span class="c-2"> The distinction between expression and performativeness is crucial. If </span><span class="c-4">gender attributes and acts, the </span><span class="c-5">various ways in

~
From Parody to Politics
I began with the speculative </span><span class="c-2">question of whether feminist politics could
do without a “subject” in the category </span><span class="c-0">of women. At stake is not whether
it still makes sense, strategically or transitionally, to refer to women in
order to make representational claims in their behalf.The </span><span class="c-1">feminist “we”
is </span><span class="c-5">always and only a phantasmatic construction, one that has its purposes, but which denies the internal complexity and indeterminacy of the
term </span><span class="c-4">and constitutes itself only through the exclusion of some part of
the constituency that it simultaneously seeks to represent.</span><span class="c-0"> The tenuous
or phantasmatic status of the “we,” however, is not cause for despair or,
at least, it is not only cause for despair.The radical instability of the category sets into question the foundational restrictions on feminist political
theorizing and opens up other configurations, not only of genders and
bodies, but of politics itself.
The foundationalist reasoning of identity politics tends to assume
that an identity must first be in place in order for political interests to be
elaborated and, subsequently, political action to be taken. My </span><span class="c-3">argument
is that </span><span class="c-5">there need not be a “doer behind the deed,” but that the “doer” is
variably constructed in and through the deed.</span><span class="c-2"> </span><span class="c-3">This is not a return to an
existential theory of the self as constituted through its acts, for the existential theory maintains a prediscursive structure for both the self and
its acts. It is precisely the discursively variable construction of each in
and through the other that has interested </span><span class="c-0">me here.
~
The question of locating “agency” is usually associated with the viability of the “subject,” where the “</span><span class="c-2">subject” is understood to have some
stable existence prior to the cultural field that it negotiates.</span><span class="c-0"> Or, if the
subject is culturally </span><span class="c-1">constructed, it is nevertheless vested with an agency,
usually figured as the capacity for reflexive mediation, that remains
intact regardless of its cultural embeddedness.</span><span class="c-0"> On such a model, “culture” and “discourse” mire the subject, but do not constitute that subject.
This move to qualify and enmire the preexisting subject has appeared
necessary to </span><span class="c-1">establish a point of agency that is not fully determined by that
culture and discourse.</span><span class="c-0"> And yet, this kind of reasoning falsely presumes
(a) agency can only be established through recourse to a prediscursive
“I,” even if that “I” is found in the midst of a discursive convergence, and
(b) that to be constituted by discourse is to be determined by discourse,
where determination forecloses the possibility of agency.
Even within the theories that maintain a highly qualified or situated subject, the subject still encounters its discursively constituted
environment in an oppositional epistemological frame. The culturally
enmired subject negotiates its constructions, even when those constructions are the very predicates of its own identity. In Beauvoir, for
example, there is an “I” that does its gender, that becomes its gender,
but that “I,” invariably associated with its gender, is nevertheless a point
of agency never fully identifiable with its gender. That cogito is never
fully of the cultural world that it negotiates, no matter the narrowness
of the ontological distance that separates that subject from its cultural
predicates. The theories of </span><span class="c-2">feminist identity that </span><span class="c-4">elaborate predicates
of color, sexuality, ethnicity, class, and able-bodiedness </span><span class="c-5">invariably close
with an embarrassed “etc.” at the end of the list.</span><span class="c-3">Through this horizontal trajectory of adjectives, these positions strive to encompass a situated subject, but invariably fail to be complete.</span><span class="c-2"> </span><span class="c-3">This failure, however, is
instructive: what political impetus is to be derived from the exasperated “etc.</span><span class="c-2">” that so </span><span class="c-3">often occurs at the end of such lines? This is a sign of
exhaustion as well as of the illimitable process of signification itself. It
is the </span><span class="c-4">supplément, the excess that necessarily accompanies any effort to
~
posit identity once </span><span class="c-3">and for all.</span><span class="c-2">This illimitable et cetera,</span><span class="c-1"> however, offers
itself as a new departure for feminist political </span><span class="c-0">theorizing.
If identity is asserted through a process of signification, if identity
is always already signified, and yet continues to signify as it circulates
within various interlocking discourses, then the </span><span class="c-2">question of agency is
not to be answered through recourse to an “I” that preexists </span><span class="c-3">signification. In </span><span class="c-4">other words, the </span><span class="c-6">enabling conditions for an assertion of “I” are
provided by the structure of signification,</span><span class="c-3"> the rules that regulate the
legitimate and illegitimate invocation of that pronoun, the practices
that establish the terms of intelligibility by which that pronoun can circulate.</span><span class="c-0"> Language is not an exterior medium or instrument into which I
pour a self and from which I glean a reflection of that self. The
Hegelian model of self-recognition that has been appropriated by
Marx, Lukacs, and a variety of contemporary liberatory discourses
presupposes a potential adequation between the “I” that confronts its
world, including its language, as an object, and the “I” that finds itself as
an object in that world. But the subject/object dichotomy, which here
belongs to the tradition of Western epistemology, conditions the very
problematic of identity that it seeks to solve.
What discursive tradition establishes the “I” and its “Other” in an
epistemological confrontation that subsequently decides where and
how questions of knowability and agency are to be determined? What
kinds of agency are foreclosed through the positing of an epistemological subject precisely because the rules and practices that govern the
invocation of that subject and regulate its agency in advance are ruled
out as sites of analysis and critical intervention? That the </span><span class="c-1">epistemological point of departure is in no sense inevitable is naively and pervasively confirmed by the mundane operations of ordinary language—widely
documented within anthropology—that regard the subject/object
dichotomy as a strange and contingent, if not violent, philosophical imposition.</span><span class="c-0"> The language of appropriation, instrumentality, and
distanciation germane to the epistemological mode also belong to a
strategy of domination that pits the “I” against an “Other” and, once
~
that separation is effected, creates an artificial set of questions about
the knowability and recoverability of that Other.
As part of the epistemological inheritance of contemporary political discourses of identity, this binary opposition is a strategic move
within a given set of signifying practices, one that establishes the “I” in
and through this opposition and which reifies that opposition as a
necessity, concealing the discursive apparatus by which the binary
itself is constituted.The </span><span class="c-1">shift from an epistemological account of identity
to one which locates the problematic </span><span class="c-2">within practices </span><span class="c-1">of signification
permits an analysis that takes the epistemological mode itself as one
possible and contingent signifying practice. Further,</span><span class="c-0"> the question of
agency is reformulated as a question of how signification and resignification work. In other words, what is signified as an identity is not </span><span class="c-2">signified at a given point in time after which it is simply there as an inert
piece of entitative language.</span><span class="c-0"> Clearly, identities can appear as so many
inert substantives; indeed, epistemological models tend to take this
appearance as their point of theoretical departure. However, the substantive “I” only </span><span class="c-1">appears as such through a signifying practice that seeks
to conceal its own workings and to naturalize its effects.</span><span class="c-0"> Further, to
qualify as a substantive identity is an arduous task, for such appearances are rule-generated identities, ones which rely on the consistent
and repeated invocation of rules that condition and restrict culturally
intelligible practices of identity. </span><span class="c-1">Indeed, to </span><span class="c-4">understand identity as a
practice, and as a </span><span class="c-5">signifying practice, is to understand culturally intelligible subjects as the </span><span class="c-7">resulting </span><span class="c-8">effects of a rule-bound discourse that
</span><span class="c-9">inserts itself in the pervasive and mundane signifying acts of linguistic
</span><span class="c-7">life.</span><span class="c-0"> Abstractly considered, language refers to an open system of signs
by which intelligibility is insistently created and contested. As historically specific organizations of language, discourses present themselves
in the plural, coexisting within temporal frames, and instituting
unpredictable and inadvertent convergences from which specific
modalities of discursive possibilities are engendered.
~
logical discourse refers to as “agency.”The </span><span class="c-1">rules that govern intelligible
identity, i.e., that enable and restrict the intelligible assertion of an “I,”
rules that are partially structured along matrices of gender hierarchy
and compulsory heterosexuality, operate through repetition.</span><span class="c-0"> Indeed,
when the </span><span class="c-2">subject is said to be constituted, that means simply that the
</span><span class="c-3">subject is a consequence of certain rule-governed discourses that govern the intelligible invocation of identity. The </span><span class="c-8">subject is not determined
by the </span><span class="c-9">rules through which it is </span><span class="c-10">generated because </span><span class="c-13">signification is not a
founding act,</span><span class="c-11"> but </span><span class="c-13">rather a </span><span class="c-14">regulated </span><span class="c-16">process of repetition </span><span class="c-13">that both conceals
</span><span class="c-12">itself and enforces its rules precisely through the production of substantializing effects.</span><span class="c-6"> In a </span><span class="c-7">sense, </span><span class="c-11">all signification takes place </span><span class="c-9">within the
orbit of the compulsion to repeat; “agency,” then, is to be located within the possibility of a variation </span><span class="c-8">on that repetition.</span><span class="c-0"> If the </span><span class="c-2">rules governing
signification not only restrict, but enable the assertion of </span><span class="c-3">alternative
domains of cultural intelligibility, i.e., new possibilities for gender that
contest the rigid codes of hierarchical binarisms,</span><span class="c-1"> then it is only </span><span class="c-6">within
the practices of repetitive signifying that a subversion of identity
becomes </span><span class="c-5">possible.</span><span class="c-2">The </span><span class="c-6">injunction to be a given gender </span><span class="c-7">produces necessary failures, a </span><span class="c-9">variety of incoherent configurations that in their multiplicity exceed and defy the injunction by which they are generated.</span><span class="c-0">
Further, the very injunction to be a given gender takes place through
discursive routes: to be a good mother, to be a heterosexually desirable
object, to be a fit worker, in sum, to signify a multiplicity of guarantees
in response to a variety of different demands all at once. The coexistence or convergence of such discursive injunctions produces the possibility of a complex reconfiguration and redeployment; it is not a
transcendental subject who enables action in the midst of such a convergence. There is no self that is prior to the convergence or who
maintains “integrity” </span><span class="c-2">prior to its entrance into this conflicted cultural
field. </span><span class="c-4">There is only a taking up of the tools where they lie, where the
very “taking </span><span class="c-2">up” is enabled by the tool lying there.</span><span class="c-0">
What </span><span class="c-2">constitutes a subversive repetition within signifying practices of gender? I have argued (“I” deploy the grammar that governs <a name="b-42"></a>the
~
genre of the philosophical conclusion, but note that it is the grammar
itself that deploys and enables this “I,” even as the “I” that insists itself
here repeats, redeploys, and—as the critics will determine—contests
the </span><span class="c-4">philosophical grammar by which it is both enabled and restricted)
that, for instance, within the sex/gender distinction, sex poses as “the
real” and the “factic,” the material or corporeal ground upon which
gender operates as an act of cultural </span><span class="c-2">inscription.</span><span class="c-0"> And yet gender is not
written on the body as the torturing instrument of writing in Kafka’s
“In the Penal Colony” inscribes itself unintelligibly on the flesh of the
accused.The question is not: what meaning does that inscription carry
within it, but what cultural apparatus arranges this meeting between
instrument and body, what interventions into this ritualistic repetition
are possible? The “</span><span class="c-1">real” and the “sexually factic” </span><span class="c-2">are phantasmatic constructions—</span><span class="c-3">illusions of substance—that bodies are compelled to
approximate, but never </span><span class="c-1">can. What, then, </span><span class="c-3">enables the exposure of the
rift between the phantasmatic and the real whereby the real admits
itself as phantasmatic?</span><span class="c-1"> Does this offer the </span><span class="c-2">possibility for a repetition
that is not fully constrained by the injunction to reconsolidate naturalized identities? Just as </span><span class="c-5">bodily surfaces are enacted as the natural, so
</span><span class="c-6">these surfaces can </span><span class="c-8">become the site of a </span><span class="c-9">dissonant and denaturalized
performance that reveals the performative status of the natural </span><span class="c-0">itself.
</span><span class="c-3">Practices of parody can serve to reengage and reconsolidate the
very distinction between a privileged and naturalized gender configuration and one that appears as derived, phantasmatic, and mimetic—a
failed copy, as it were.</span><span class="c-2"> And surely parody has been used to further a
</span><span class="c-4">politics of despair, one which affirms a seemingly inevitable exclusion
of marginal genders from the territory of the natural and the real.</span><span class="c-2"> And
yet this failure to become “real” and to embody “the natural” is, I would
argue, a constitutive failure of all gender enactments for the very reason that these ontological locales are fundamentally uninhabitable.
Hence, there is a subversive laughter in the pastiche-effect of parodic
practices in which the original, the authentic, and the real are them-

~
selves </span><span class="c-7">constituted as effects. The loss of gender norms </span><span class="c-8">would have the
</span><span class="c-9">effect of proliferating gender configurations, destabilizing substantive
identity, and </span><span class="c-11">depriving the naturalizing narratives of compulsory heterosexuality of their central protagonists:</span><span class="c-6"> “man”</span><span class="c-3"> and “woman.” The
</span><span class="c-6">parodic repetition of gender exposes as well the illusion of gender
identity as an intractable depth and inner substance.</span><span class="c-4"> As the </span><span class="c-5">effects of a
subtle and politically enforced performativity, gender is an “act,</span><span class="c-4">” as it
were, that is </span><span class="c-6">open </span><span class="c-5">to splittings, self-parody, self-criticism, and those
hyperbolic exhibitions of “the natural” that, in their very exaggeration,
reveal its fundamentally phantasmatic </span><span class="c-3">status.</span><span class="c-0">
I have tried to suggest that the </span><span class="c-1">identity categories often presumed
to be foundational to feminist politics, that is, deemed necessary in
order to mobilize feminism as an identity politics, simultaneously
work to limit and constrain in advance the very cultural possibilities
that feminism is supposed to open </span><span class="c-0">up. The tacit constraints that produce culturally intelligible “sex” ought to be understood as generative
political structures rather than naturalized foundations. </span><span class="c-1">Paradoxically,
the </span><span class="c-5">reconceptualization of identity as an effect, that is, as produced or
generated, opens up </span><span class="c-7">possibilities of “agency” that </span><span class="c-11">are insidiously foreclosed by positions that take identity </span><span class="c-10">categories </span><span class="c-7">as foundational and
fixed.</span><span class="c-1"> For an identity to be an effect means that it is neither fatally
determined nor fully artificial and arbitrary.</span><span class="c-0"> That the constituted status
of identity is misconstrued along these two conflicting lines suggests
the ways in which the feminist discourse on cultural construction
remains trapped within the unnecessary binarism of free will and
determinism. </span><span class="c-8">Construction is not opposed to agency; it is the </span><span class="c-9">necessary scene of </span><span class="c-11">agency, the very terms in which agency is articulated </span><span class="c-10">and
becomes culturally </span><span class="c-9">intelligible.</span><span class="c-1"> The </span><span class="c-2">critical task for feminism is not to
establish a point of view outside of constructed identities;</span><span class="c-1"> that conceit
is the construction of an epistemological model that would disavow its
own cultural location and, hence, promote itself as a global subject, a
position that deploys precisely the imperialist strategies that feminism

~
ought to criticize.The critical task is, rather, to locate strategies of subversive repetition </span><span class="c-2">enabled by those constructions, to </span><span class="c-3">affirm the local
possibilities of intervention through participating in precisely those
practices of repetition that constitute identity and, therefore, present
the immanent possibility of contesting </span><span class="c-1">them.
This </span><span class="c-0">theoretical inquiry has attempted to locate the political in the
very signifying practices that establish, regulate, and deregulate identity. This effort, however, can only be accomplished through the introduction of a set of questions that extend the very notion of the
political. How to disrupt the foundations that cover over alternative
cultural configurations of gender? How to destabilize and render in
their phantasmatic dimension the “premises” of identity politics?
This task has required a critical genealogy of the naturalization of
sex and of bodies in general. It has also demanded a reconsideration of
the figure of the body as mute, prior to culture, awaiting signification,
a figure that cross-checks with the figure of the feminine, awaiting the
inscription-as-incision of the masculine signifier for entrance into language and culture. From a political analysis of compulsory heterosexuality, it has been necessary to question the construction of sex as
binary, as a hierarchical binary. From the point of view of gender as
enacted, questions have emerged over the fixity of gender identity as
an interior depth that is said to be externalized in various forms of
“expression.” The implicit construction of the primary heterosexual
construction of desire is shown to persist even as it appears in the
mode of primary bisexuality. Strategies of exclusion and hierarchy are
also shown to persist in the formulation of the sex/gender distinction
and its recourse to “sex” as the prediscursive as well as the priority of
sexuality to culture and, in particular, the cultural construction of sexuality as the prediscursive. Finally, the epistemological paradigm that
presumes the priority of the doer to the deed establishes a global and
globalizing subject who disavows its own locality as well as the conditions for local intervention.

~
If taken as the grounds of feminist theory or politics, these
“effects” of gender hierarchy and compulsory heterosexuality are not
only misdescribed as foundations, but the signifying practices that
enable this metaleptic misdescription remain outside the purview of a
feminist critique of gender relations.To </span><span class="c-3">enter into the repetitive practices of this terrain of signification is not a choice, for the “I” that might
enter is always already inside:</span><span class="c-2"> </span><span class="c-4">there is no possibility of agency or reality outside of the discursive practices that give those terms the intelligibility that they have.</span><span class="c-2"> The </span><span class="c-4">task is not </span><span class="c-5">whether to </span><span class="c-6">repeat, but how to
repeat or, indeed, to </span><span class="c-10">repeat and, through a radical proliferation of gender,</span><span class="c-9"> to displace the very gender norms that enable the repetition </span><span class="c-0">itself.
</span><span class="c-3">There is no ontology of gender on which we might construct a politics, for gender ontologies always operate within established political
contexts as normative injunctions,</span><span class="c-2"> determining what qualifies as intelligible sex, invoking and consolidating the reproductive constraints on
sexuality, setting the prescriptive requirements whereby sexed or gendered bodies come into cultural intelligibility.</span><span class="c-0"> Ontology is, thus, not a
foundation, but a </span><span class="c-2">normative injunction that operates insidiously by
installing itself into political discourse as its necessary ground.</span><span class="c-0">
The </span><span class="c-5">deconstruction of identity is not the </span><span class="c-8">deconstruction of politics; rather, it establishes as political the very terms through which
identity is articulated.</span><span class="c-1"> This kind of critique </span><span class="c-2">brings into question the
foundationalist frame in which feminism as an identity politics has
been </span><span class="c-3">articulated.</span><span class="c-1">The internal paradox of this foundationalism is that it
presumes, fixes, and constrains the very “subjects” that it hopes to represent and liberate. The task here is not to celebrate each and every
new possibility qua possibility, but to redescribe those possibilities that
already exist, but which exist within cultural domains designated as
culturally unintelligible and impossible.</span><span class="c-0"> If </span><span class="c-4">identities were no longer
fixed as the </span><span class="c-5">premises of a political syllogism, and politics no longer
understood as a set of practices derived from the alleged interests that
belong to a set of ready-made subjects, a </span><span class="c-6">new configuration of politics

~
would surely emerge from the ruins of the old.</span><span class="c-1"> </span><span class="c-3">Cultural configurations
of sex and gender might then proliferate </span><span class="c-2">or, rather, their present proliferation might then become articulable </span><span class="c-3">within the discourses that
establish intelligible cultural life, confounding the very binarism of
sex, and exposing its fundamental unnaturalness.</span><span class="c-2"> What other </span><span class="c-0">local
strategies for engaging the “unnatural” might lead to the denaturalization of gender as such?

1. At this printing, there are French publishers considering the translation
of this work, but only because Didier Eribon and others have inserted the
arguments of the text into current French political debates on the legal

Sedgwick’s monumental </span><span class="c-10">Epistemology of the Closet (Berkeley and Los

arguments here were not able to benefit from her nuanced discussion of
gender and sexuality in the first chapter of that book.
5. Jonathan Goldberg persuaded me of this point.

~
Diana Fuss, Jay Presser, Lisa Duggan, and Elizabeth Grosz for their insightful criticisms of the theory of performativity.
8. This notion of the ritual dimension of performativity is allied with the
notion of the habitus in Pierre Bourdieu’s work, something which I only
came to realize after the fact of writing this text. For my belated effort to
account for this resonance, see the final chapter of </span><span class="c-72">Excitable Speech: A
Politics of the Performative (New York: Routledge,</span><span class="c-0"> 1997).
9. Jacqueline Rose usefully pointed out to me the disjunction between the
earlier and later parts of this text. The earlier parts interrogate the
melancholy construction of gender, but the later seem to forget the psychoanalytic beginnings. Perhaps this accounts for some of the “mania” of
the final chapter, a state defined by Freud as part of the disavowal of loss
that is melancholia. Gender Trouble in its closing pages seems to forget or
disavow the loss it has just articulated.
10. See Bodies that Matter (New York: Routledge, 1993) as well as an able and

11. Saidiya Hartman, Lisa Lowe, and Dorinne Kondo are scholars whose
work has influenced my own. Much of the current scholarship on “passing” has also taken up this question. My own essay on Nella Larsen’s
“Passing” in Bodies That Matter sought to address the question in a preliminary way. Of course, Homi Bhabha’s work on the mimetic splitting of the
postcolonial subject is close to my own in several ways: not only the
appropriation of the colonial “voice” by the colonized, but the split condition of identification are crucial to a notion of performativity that
emphasizes the way minority identities are produced and riven at the
same time under conditions of domination.
12. The work of Kobena Mercer, Kendall Thomas, and Hortense Spillers has
been extremely useful to my post-Gender Trouble thinking on this subject.
I also hope to publish an essay on Frantz Fanon soon engaging questions
of mimesis and hyperbole in his Black Skins,White Masks. I am grateful to
Greg Thomas, who has recently completed his dissertation in rhetoric at
Berkeley, on racialized sexualities in the U.S., for provoking and enriching my understanding of this crucial intersection.

1. Subjects of Sex/Gender/Desire
1. See Michel Foucault, “Right of Death and Power over Life,” in The </span><span class="c-13">History
of Sexuality, </span><span class="c-15">Volume I, An </span><span class="c-40">Introduction, </span><span class="c-41">trans. Robert Hurley </span><span class="c-38">(New York:</span><span class="c-36">
Vintage,</span><span class="c-1"> 1980), originally published as </span><span class="c-4">Histoire de la sexualité 1: La volonté
de savoir (Paris: Gallimard,</span><span class="c-0"> 1978). In that final chapter, Foucault discusses
the relation between the juridical and productive law. His notion of the
productivity of the law is clearly derived from Nietzsche, although not
identical with Nietzsche’s will-to-power. The use of Foucault’s notion of
productive power is not meant as a simple-minded “application” of
Foucault to gender issues. As I show in chapter 3, section ii, “Foucault,
Herculine, and the Politics of Sexual Discontinuity,” the consideration of
sexual difference within the terms of Foucault’s own work reveals central contradictions in his theory. His view of the body also comes under
criticism in the final chapter.
2. References throughout this work to a subject before the law are extrapolations of Derrida’s reading of Kafka’s </span><span class="c-1">parable “Before the Law,” in Kafka

Feminist Theory,” in </span><span class="c-1">Sex and Scientific Inquiry, eds. Sandra Harding and
Jean F. O’Barr (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,</span><span class="c-0"> 1987), pp.
283–302.
5. I am reminded of the ambiguity inherent in Nancy Cott’s title, The
</span><span class="c-2">Grounding of Modern Feminism (New Haven:Yale University Press,</span><span class="c-0"> 1987).
She argues that the early twentieth-century U.S. feminist movement
sought to “ground” itself in a program that eventually “grounded” that
movement. Her historical thesis implicitly raises the question of whether
uncritically accepted foundations operate like the “return of the
repressed”; based on exclusionary practices, the stable political identities
that found political movements may invariably become threatened by the
very instability that the foundationalist move creates.
6. I use the term heterosexual matrix throughout the text to </span><span class="c-4">designate that
</span><span class="c-10">grid of cultural intelligibility through which bodies, genders, and desires
are </span><span class="c-8">naturalized.</span><span class="c-0"> I am drawing from Monique Wittig’s notion of the “heterosexual contract” and, to a lesser extent, on Adrienne Rich’s notion of
“compulsory heterosexuality” to </span><span class="c-1">characterize a </span><span class="c-5">hegemonic </span><span class="c-6">discursive/
epistemic model of gender intelligibility that </span><span class="c-7">assumes that for </span><span class="c-8">bodies to
cohere and make sense there must be a stable sex expressed through a
stable gender </span><span class="c-4">(masculine expresses male, feminine expresses female)
that is oppositionally and hierarchically defined through the compulsory
practice of heterosexuality.</span><span class="c-1">

9. A great deal of feminist research has been conducted within the fields of
biology and the history of science that assess the political interests inherent in the various discriminatory procedures that establish the scientific
basis for sex. See Ruth Hubbard and Marian Lowe, eds., Genes and Gender,

feminism and science of Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy, Vol. 2,

10. Clearly Foucault’s History of Sexuality offers one way to rethink the history
of “sex” within a given modern Eurocentric context. For a more detailed

Merleau-Ponty’s, and Beauvoir’s tend to use the term embodiment. Drawn
as it is from theological contexts, the term </span><span class="c-1">tends to figure “the” body as a

20. The normative ideal of the body as both a “situation” and an “instrumentality” is embraced by both Beauvoir with respect to gender and Frantz
Fanon with respect to race. Fanon concludes his analysis of colonization
through recourse to the body as an instrument of freedom, where freedom is, in Cartesian fashion, equated with a consciousness capable of
doubt: “O my body, make of me always a man who questions!” (</span><span class="c-4">Frantz
</span><span class="c-12">Fanon, </span><span class="c-22">Black Skin,White Masks [New York:</span><span class="c-21"> Grove </span><span class="c-14">Press,</span><span class="c-0"> 1967] p. 323,
originally published as Peau noire, masques blancs [Paris: Éditions de Seuil,

21. The </span><span class="c-1">radical ontological disjunction in Sartre between consciousness and
the body is part of the Cartesian inheritance of his ph<a name="b-44"></a>ilosophy.</span><span class="c-0"> Significantly, it is Descartes’ distinction that Hegel implicitly interrogates at
the outset of the “Master-Slave” section of The Phenomenology of Spirit.
Beauvoir’s analysis of the masculine Subject and the feminine Other is
clearly situated in Hegel’s dialectic and in the Sartrian reformulation of
that dialectic in the section on sadism and masochism in Being and
Nothingness. </span><span class="c-1">Critical of the very possibility of a “synthesis” of consciousness and the body, Sartre effectively returns to the Cartesian problematic that Hegel sought to overcome. Beauvoir insists that the body can be
the instrument and situation of freedom and that </span><span class="c-2">sex can be the occasion
for a gender that is not a reification, but a modality of freedom. At first
this appears to be a synthesis of body and consciousness, where consciousness is understood as the condition of freedom. The question that

~
remains, however, is whether this synthesis requires and maintains the
ontological distinction between body and mind </span><span class="c-1">of which it is composed
and, by association, the hierarchy of mind over body and of masculine
over feminine.</span><span class="c-0">

Views,” Feminist Studies,</span><span class="c-0"> Vol. 8, No. 1, Spring 1982.
23. Gayatri Spivak most pointedly elaborates this particular kind of binary
explanation as a colonizing act of marginalization. In a critique of the
“self-presence of the cognizing supra-historical self,” which is characteristic of the epistemic imperialism of the philosophical cogito, she locates
politics in the production of knowledge that creates and censors the margins that constitute, through exclusion, the contingent intelligibility of
that subject’s given knowledge-regime: “I call ‘politics as such’ the </span><span class="c-1">prohibition of marginality that is implicit in the production of any explanation. From that point of view, the choice of particular binary oppositions
</span><span class="c-0">. . . is no mere intellectual strategy. It is, in each case, the condition of the
possibility for centralization (with appropriate apologies) and, correspondingly, marginalization” (</span><span class="c-2">Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, “Explanation
and Culture: Marginalia,” in In </span><span class="c-22">Other Worlds: Essays in Cultural Politics [New

27. The notion of the “Symbolic” is discussed at some length in Section Two
of this text. It is to be understood as an ideal and universal set of

~
cultural laws that govern kinship and signification and, within the
terms of psychoanalytic structuralism, govern the production of sexual
difference. Based on the notion of an idealized “paternal law,” the
Symbolic is reformulated by Irigaray as a dominant and hegemonic discourse of phallogocentrism. Some French feminists propose an alternative language to one governed by the Phallus or the paternal law, and so
wage a critique against the Symbolic. Kristeva proposes the “semiotic” as
a specifically maternal dimension of language, and both Irigaray and
Hélène Cixous have been associated with écriture feminine. Wittig, however, has always resisted that movement, claiming that language in its structure is neither misogynist nor feminist, but an instrument to be deployed
for developed political purposes. Clearly her belief in a “cognitive subject” that exists prior to language facilitates her understanding of language as an instrument, rather than as a field of significations that
preexist and structure subject-formation itself.

30. The journal, Questions Feministes, available in English translation as Feminist
Issues, generally defended a “materialist” point of view which took practices, institution, and the constructed status of language to be the “material grounds” of the oppression of women.Wittig was part of the original
editorial staff. Along with Monique Plaza, Wittig argued that sexual difference was essentialist in that it derived the meaning of women’s social
function from their biological facticity, but also because it subscribed to
the primary signification of women’s bodies as maternal and, hence, gave
ideological strength to the hegemony of reproductive sexuality.

34. Aretha’s song, originally written by Carole King, also contests the naturalization of gender. “Like a natural woman” is a phrase that suggests that
“naturalness” is only </span><span class="c-2">accomplished through analogy or metaphor. In other
words, “You make me feel like a metaphor of the natural,” and without
</span><span class="c-0">“you,” some denaturalized ground would be revealed. For a further discussion of Aretha’s claim in light of Simone de Beauvoir’s contention that
“one is not born, but rather becomes a woman,” see my “Beauvoir’s

42. Clearly,Wittig does not understand syntax to be the linguistic elaboration
or reproduction of a kinship system paternally organized. Her refusal of
structuralism at this level allows her to understand language as gender-

~
neutral. Irigaray’s Parler n’est jamais neutre (Paris: Éditions de Minuit,
1985) criticizes precisely the kind of humanist position, here characteristic of Wittig, that claims the political and gender neutrality of language.

51. “What distinguishes psychoanalysis from sociological accounts of gender
(hence for me the fundamental impasse of Nancy Chodorow’s work) is
that whereas for the latter, the internalisation of norms is assumed
roughly to work, the basic premise and indeed starting point of psychoanalysis is that it does not. The unconscious constantly reveals the ‘failure’ of identity” (Jacqueline Rose, Sexuality in the Field of Vision, p. 90).
52. It is, perhaps, no wonder that the singular structuralist notion of “the
Law” clearly resonates with the prohibitive law of the Old Testament.The
“paternal law” thus comes under a post-structuralist critique through the
understandable route of a French reappropriation of Nietzsche.
Nietzsche faults the Judeo-Christian “slave-morality” for conceiving the
law in both singular and prohibitive terms. The will-to-power, on the
other hand, designates both the productive and multiple possibilities of
the law, effectively exposing the notion of “the Law” in its singularity as a
fictive and repressive notion.

54. Irigaray’s perhaps most controversial claim has been that the structure
of the vulva as “two lips touching” constitutes the nonunitary and autoerotic pleasure of women prior to the “separation” of this doubleness
through the pleasure-depriving act of penetration by the penis. See
Irigaray, Ce sexe qui n’en est pas un. Along with Monique Plaza and
Christine Delphy, Wittig has argued that Irigaray’s valorization of
that anatomical specificity is itself an uncritical replication of a reproductive discourse that marks and carves up the female body into artificial “parts” like “vagina,” “clitoris,” and “vulva.” At a lecture at Vassar
College,Wittig was asked whether she had a vagina, and she replied that
she did not.

gender,</span><span class="c-0"> reveals the “original” as a failed effort to “copy” a phantasmatic
ideal that cannot be copied without failure. See </span><span class="c-1">Fredric </span><span class="c-2">Jameson,

2. Prohibition, Psychoanalysis, and the Production of the
Heterosexual Matrix
1. During the semester in which I write this chapter, I am teaching Kafka’s
“In the Penal Colony,” which describes an instrument of torture that
provides an interesting analogy for the contemporary field of power and
masculinist power in particular. The narrative repeatedly falters in its
attempt to recount the history which would enshrine that instrument as
a vital part of a tradition. The origins cannot be recovered, and the map
that might lead to the origins has become unreadable through time.
Those to whom it might be explained do not speak the same language
and have no recourse to translation. Indeed, the machine itself cannot be
fully imagined; its parts don’t fit together in a conceivable whole, so the
reader is forced to imagine its state of fragmentation without recourse to
an ideal notion of its integrity.This appears to be a literary enactment of
Foucault’s notion that “power” has become so diffuse that it no longer
exists as a systematic totality. Derrida interrogates the problematic
authority of such a law in the context of Kafka’s “Before the Law” (in
Derrida’s “Before the Law,” in Kafka and the Contemporary Critical Performance: Centenary Readings, ed. Alan Udoff [Bloomington: Indiana
University Press, 1987]). He underscores the radical unjustifiability of
this repression through a narrative recapitulation of a time before the
law. Significantly, it also remains impossible to articulate a critique of
that law through recourse to a time before the law.

Press,</span><span class="c-0"> 1985) in light of Lévi-Strauss’s description of the structures of
reciprocity within kinship. Sedgwick effectively argues that the flattering
attentions paid to women in romantic poetry are both a deflection and
an elaboration of male homosocial desire. Women are poetic “objects
of exchange” in the sense that they mediate the relationship of unacknowledged desire between men as the explicit and ostensible object
of discourse.

15. Freud understood the achievement of femininity to require a doublewave of repression: “The girl” not only has to shift libidinal attachment

18. The feminist literature on masquerade is wide-ranging; the attempt here
is restricted to an analysis of masquerade in relation to the problematic
of expression and performativity. In other words, the question here is
whether masquerade conceals a femininity that might be understood as
genuine or authentic, or whether masquerade is the means by which
femininity and the contests over its “authenticity” are produced. For a
fuller discussion of feminist appropriations of masquerade, see </span><span class="c-1">Mary Ann

19. In the following section of this chapter, “Freud and the Melancholia of

</span><span class="c-1">consequence of a disavowed grief as it applies to the incest taboo which
founds sexual positions and gender through instituting certain forms of
disavowed losses.</span><span class="c-0">
20. Significantly, Lacan’s discussion of the lesbian is continguous within the
text to his discussion of frigidity, as if to suggest metonymically that lesbianism constitutes the denial of sexuality. A further reading of the operation of “denial” in this text is clearly in order.

Newton and Shirley Walton, “The Misunderstanding: Toward a More
Precise Sexual Vocabulary,” in Pleasure and Danger, ed. Carole Vance
(Boston: Routledge,</span><span class="c-0"> 1984), pp. 242–250. Newton and Walton distinguish among erotic identities, erotic roles, and erotic acts and show how
radical discontinuities can exist between styles of desire and styles of
gender such that erotic preferences cannot be directly inferred from the
presentation of an erotic identity in social contexts. Although I find
their analysis useful (and brave), I wonder whether such categories are
themselves specific to discursive contexts and whether that kind of fragmentation of sexuality into component “parts” makes sense only as a
counterstrategy to refute the reductive unification of these terms.

Although she disputes the term because it puts into question the autonomy of the person described, I would emphasize that “orientations” themselves are rarely, if ever, fixed. Obviously, they can shift through time and
are open to cultural reformulations that are in no sense univocal.

30. See Friedrich Nietzsche, “First Essay,” in The Genealogy of Morals, trans.
Walter Kaufmann (New York: Vintage, 1969), for his analysis of slavemorality. Here as elsewhere in his writing, Nietzsche argues that God is
created by the will-to-power as a self-debasing act and that the recovery
of the will-to-power from this construct of self-subjection is possible
through a reclaiming of the very creative powers that produced the
thought of God and, paradoxically, of human powerlessness. Foucault’s
Discipline and Punish is clearly based on On the Genealogy of Morals, most
clearly the “Second Essay” as well as Nietzsche’s Daybreak. His distinction
between productive and juridical power is also clearly rooted in
Nietzsche’s analysis of the self-subjection of the will. In Foucault’s terms,
the construction of the juridical law is the effect of productive power,
but one in which productive power institutes its own concealment and
subordination. Foucault’s critique of Lacan (see History of Sexuality,Volume
I,An Introduction, trans. Robert Hurley [New York:Vintage, 1980], p. 81)
and the repressive hypothesis generally centers on the overdetermined
status of the juridical law.

text is based in part on the writings of Melanie Klein. Melancholy is the

~
matricidal impulse turned against the female subject and hence is linked
with the problem of masochism. Kristeva appears to accept the notion of
primary aggression in this text and to differentiate the sexes according to
the primary object of aggression and the manner in which they refuse to
commit the murders they most profoundly want to commit. The masculine position is thus understood as an externally directed sadism, whereas
the feminine is an internally directed masochism. For Kristeva, melancholy is a “voluptuous sadness” that seems tied to the sublimated production of art. The highest form of that sublimation seems to center on the
suffering that is its origin. As a result, Kristeva ends the book, abruptly
and a bit polemically, extolling the great works of modernism that articulate the tragic structure of human action and condemning the postmodern
effort to affirm, rather than to suffer, contemporary fragmentations of the
psyche. For a discussion of the role of melancholy in “Motherhood
According to Bellini,” see chapter 3, section i, of this text, “The Body

41. See Schafer, A New Language for Psychoanalysis, p. 177. In this and in his earlier work, Aspects of Internalization, Schaefer makes clear that the tropes
of internalized spaces are phantasmatic constructions, but not processes.
This clearly coincides in an interesting way with the thesis put forward
by Nicholas Abraham and Maria Torok that “Incorporation is merely a
fantasy that reassures the ego” (“Introjection-Incorporation,” p. 5).
42. Clearly, this is the theoretical foundation of Monique Wittig’s The Lesbian
Body, trans. Peter Owen (New York: Avon, 1976), which suggests that the
heterosexualized female body is compartmentalized and rendered sexu-

~
ally unresponsive. The dismembering and remembering process of that
body through lesbian love-making performs the “inversion” that reveals
the so-called integrated body as fully disintegrated and deeroticized and
the “literally” disintegrated body as capable of sexual pleasure throughout
the surfaces of the body. Significantly, there are no stable surfaces on
these bodies, for the political principle of compulsory heterosexuality is
understood to determine what counts as a whole, completed, and
anatomically discrete body. Wittig’s narrative (which is at once an antinarrative) brings those culturally constructed notions of bodily integrity
into question.
43. This notion of the surface of the body as projected is partially addressed
by Freud’s own concept of “the bodily ego.” Freud’s claim that “the ego
is first and foremost a bodily ego” (The Ego and the Id, p. 16) suggests
that there is a concept of the body that determines ego-development.
Freud continues the above sentence: “[the body] is not merely a surface
entity, but is itself the projection of a surface.” For an interesting discussion of Freud’s view, see Richard Wollheim, “The bodily ego,” in
Philosophical Essays on Freud, eds. Richard Wollheim and James Hopkins
(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1982). For a provocative
account of “the skin ego,” which, unfortunately, does not consider the
implications of its account for the sexed body, see Didier Anzieu, Le moipeau (Paris: Bordas, 1985), published in English as The Skin Ego: A

almost genderless, while French passes for a very gendered language. It
is true that strictly speaking, English does not apply the mark of gender
to inanimate objects, to things or nonhuman beings. But as far as the categories of the person are concerned, both languages are bearers of gender to the same extent” (“The Mark of Gender,” Feminist Issues, Vol. 5, No.

(Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1979), p. 119. Consider the radical
difference, however, between Wittig’s acceptance of the use of language
that valorizes the speaking subject as autonomous and universal and
Deleuze’s Nietzschean effort to displace the speaking “I” as the center of
linguistic power. Although both are critical of psychoanalysis, Deleuze’s
critique of the subject through recourse to the will-to-power sustains
closer parallels to the displacement of the speaking subject by the
semiotic/unconscious within Lacanian and post-Lacanian psychoanalytic discourse. For Wittig, it appears that sexuality and desire are selfdetermined articulations of the individual subject, whereas for both
Deleuze and his psychoanalytic opponents, desire of necessity displaces
and decenters the subject. “Far from presupposing a subject,” Deleuze
argues, “desire cannot be attained except at the point where someone is

46. “The Site of Action,” p. 135. In this essay, Wittig distinguishes between a
“first” and “second” contract within society:The first is one of radical reciprocity between speaking subjects who exchange words that “guarantee”
the entire and exclusive disposition of language to everyone” (135); the
second contract is one in which words operate to exert a force of domination over others, indeed, to deprive others of the right and social
capacity for speech. In this “debased” form of reciprocity, Wittig argues,
individuality itself is erased through being addressed in a language that
precludes the hearer as a potential speaker. Wittig concludes the essay
with the following: “the paradise of the social contract exists only in literature, where the tropisms, by their violence, are able to counter any
reduction of the ‘I’ to a common denominator, to </span><span class="c-1">tear open the closely
woven material of the commonplaces, and to continually prevent their
organization into a system of compulsory meaning”</span><span class="c-0"> (139).

contract in terms of Rousseau’s theory of the social contract. Although
she is not explicit in this regard, it appears that she understands the presocial (preheterosexual) contract as a unity of the will—that is, as a general
will in Rousseau’s romantic sense. For an interesting use of her theory, see

own reformulation of Lacan, Kristeva writes, “Defilement is what is jettisoned from the symbolic system. It is what escapes that social rationality,
that logical order on which a social aggregate is based, which then
becomes differentiated from a temporary agglomeration of individuals
and, in short, constitutes a classification system or a structure” (p. 65).
